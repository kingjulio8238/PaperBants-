The challenges and\\nopportunities of Social Media\\nAndreas M. Kaplan *, Michael Haenlein\\nESCP Europe, 79 Avenue de la Re ´publique, F-75011 Paris, France\\n1. The specter of Social Media\\nAs of January 2009, the online social networking\\napplication Facebook registered more than 175million active users. To put that number in perspec-tive, this is only slightly less than the population of\\nBrazil (190 million) and over twice the population of\\nGermany (80 million)! At the same time, everyminute, 10 hours of content were uploaded to thevideo sharing platform YouTube. And, the imagehosting site Flickr provided access to over 3 billionphotographs, making the world-famous LouvreMuseum’s collection of 300,000 objects seem tiny\\nin comparison.\\nAccording to Forrester Research, 75% of Internet\\nsurfers used ‘‘Social Media’’ in the second quarter of2008 by joining social networks, reading blogs, or\\ncontributing reviews to shopping sites; this repre-\\nsents a signiﬁcant rise from 56% in 2007. The growthis not limited to teenagers, either; members ofGeneration X, now 35—44 years old, increasinglypopulate the ranks of joiners, spectators, and crit-ics. It is therefore reasonable to say that SocialMedia represent a revolutionary new trend thatshould be of interest to companies operating in\\nonline space– —or any space, for that matter.\\nYet, not overly many ﬁrms seem to act comfort-\\nably in a world where consumers can speak so freely\\nBusiness Horizons (2010) 53, 59—68\\nwww.elsevier .com/locate/bushor\\nKEYWORDS\\nSocial Media;\\nUser Generated\\nContent;\\nWeb 2.0;Social networking sites;\\nVirtual worldsAbstract The concept of Social Media is top of the agenda for many business\\nexecutives today. Decision makers, as well as consultants, try to identify ways in\\nwhich ﬁrms can make proﬁtable use of applications such as Wikipedia, YouTube,\\nFacebook, Second Life, and T witter. Yet despite this interest, there seems to be verylimited understanding of what the term ‘‘Social Media’’ exactly means; this article\\nintends to provide some clariﬁcation. We begin by describing the concept of Social\\nMedia, and discuss how it differs from related concepts such as Web 2.0 and UserGenerated Content. Based on this deﬁnition, we then provide a classiﬁcation of SocialMedia which groups applications currently subsumed under the generalized term into\\nmore speciﬁc categories by characteristic: collaborative projects, blogs, content\\ncommunities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds.Finally, we present 10 pieces of advice for companies which decide to utilize Social\\nMedia.\\n#2009 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Today, if an Internet user typesthe name of any leading brand into the Google\\nsearch, what comes up among the top ﬁve results\\ntypically includes not only the corporate webpage,but also the corresponding entry in the onlineencyclopedia Wikipedia. Here, for example, cus-tomers can read that the 2007 model of Hasbro’sEasy-Bake Oven may lead to serious burns on chil-dren’s hands and ﬁngers due to a poorly-designedoven door , and that the Firestone Tire and Rubber\\nCompany has been accused of using child labor in its\\nLiberian rubber factory. Historically, companieswere able to control the information available aboutthem through strategically placed press announce-ments and good public relations managers. Today,however , ﬁrms have been increasingly relegated tothe sidelines as mere observers, having neither theknowledge nor the chance– —or , sometimes, even the\\nright– —to alter publicly posted comments provided\\nby their customers. Wikipedia, for example, ex-pressly forbids the participation of ﬁrms in its onlinecommunity.\\nSuch an evolution may not be surprising. After all,\\nthe Internet started out as nothing more than a giantBulletin Board System (BBS) that allowed users toexchange software, data, messages, and news with\\neach other . The late 1990s saw a popularity surge in\\nhomepages, whereby the Average Joe could shareinformation about his private life; today’s equivalentwould be the weblog, or blog. The era of corporateweb pages and e-commerce started relatively re-cently with the launch of Amazon and eBay in1995, and got a right ticking-off only 6 years laterwhen the dot-com bubble burst in 2001. The current\\ntrend toward Social Media can therefore be seen as an\\nevolution back to the Internet’s roots, since it re-transforms the World Wide Web to what it wasinitially created for: a platform to facilitate informa-tion exchange between users. But does that meanthat Social Media is just old wine in new bottles?Probably not! As we will delve into further , thetechnical advances that have been made over the\\npast 20 years now enable a form of virtual content\\nsharing that is fundamentally different from, andmore powerful than, the BBS of the late 1970s.\\nThis article discusses the challenges and opportu-\\nnities that emerge from this evolution for ﬁrms, andprovides structure to better understand the rapidlyevolving ﬁeld of Social Media. We begin by providing adeﬁnition and classiﬁcation of Social Media by looking\\nat their historical roots, technical speciﬁcities, and\\ndifferences from other entities such as Web 2.0 andUser Generated Content. We then focus on sixtypes of Social Media– —collaborative projects, blogs,content communities, social networking sites, virtual\\ngame worlds, and virtual social worlds– —and presentways in which companies can efﬁciently make use ofthese applications. Based on this analysis, we then\\nderive a set of 10 recommendations companies\\nshould follow when thinking about developing theirown Social Media strategy, be it with respect to theseaforementioned types or other applications whichmight emerge in the future.\\n2. What is Social Media– —And what is it\\nnot?\\nAs highlighted, the idea behind Social Media is far\\nfrom groundbreaking. Nevertheless, there seems tobe confusion among managers and academic re-searchers alike as to what exactly should be includ-ed under this term, and how Social Media differ fromthe seemingly-interchangeable related concepts of\\nWeb 2.0 and User Generated Content. It therefore\\nmakes sense to take a step back and provide insightregarding where Social Media come from and whatthey include.\\nBy 1979, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis from Duke\\nUniversity had created the Usenet, a worldwidediscussion system that allowed Internet users topost public messages. Yet, the era of Social Media\\nas we understand it today probably started about 20\\nyears earlier , when Bruce and Susan Abelsonfounded ‘‘Open Diary,’’ an early social networkingsite that brought together online diary writers intoone community. The term ‘‘weblog’’ was ﬁrst usedat the same time, and truncated as ‘‘blog’’ a yearlater when one blogger jokingly transformed thenoun ‘‘weblog’’ into the sentence ‘‘we blog.’’ The\\ngrowing availability of high-speed Internet access\\nfurther added to the popularity of the concept,leading to the creation of social networking sitessuch as MySpace (in 2003) and Facebook (in 2004).This, in turn, coined the term ‘‘Social Media,’’ andcontributed to the prominence it has today. Themost recent addition to this glamorous groupinghas been so-called ‘‘virtual worlds’’: computer-\\nbased simulated environments inhabited by three-\\ndimensional avatars. Perhaps the best known virtualworld is that of Linden Lab’s Second Life ( Kaplan &\\nHaenlein, 2009c ).\\nAlthough the list of the aforementioned applica-\\ntions may give some idea about what is meant bySocial Media, a formal deﬁnition of the term ﬁrstrequires drawing a line to two related concepts that\\nare frequently named in conjunction with it: Web\\n2.0 and User Generated Content. Web 2.0 is a termthat was ﬁrst used in 2004 to describe a new way inwhich software developers and end-users started to60 A.M. Kaplan, M.

While applications\\nsuch as personal web pages, Encyclopedia BritannicaOnline, and the idea of content publishing belong tothe era of Web 1.0, they are replaced by blogs, wikis,and collaborative projects in Web 2.0. Although Web2.0 does not refer to any speciﬁc technical update ofthe World Wide Web, there is a set of basic function-alities that are necessary for its functioning. Among\\nthem are Adobe Flash (a popular method for adding\\nanimation, interactivity, and audio/video streams toweb pages), RSS (Really Simple Syndication, a familyof web feed formats used to publish frequentlyupdated content, such as blog entries or news head-lines, in a standardized format), and AJAX (Asynchro-nous Java Script, a technique to retrieve data fromweb servers asynchronously, allowing the update of\\nweb content without interfering with the display and\\nbehavior of the whole page). For the purpose of ourarticle, we consider Web 2.0 as the platform for theevolution of Social Media.\\nWhen Web 2.0 represents the ideological and\\ntechnological foundation, User Generated Content(UGC) can be seen as the sum of all ways in whichpeople make use of Social Media. The term, which\\nachieved broad popularity in 2005, is usually applied\\nto describe the various forms of media content thatare publicly available and created by end-users.According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD, 2007 ), UGC\\nneeds to fulﬁll three basic requirements in orderto be considered as such: ﬁrst, it needs to bepublished either on a publicly accessible website\\nor on a social networking site accessible to a select-\\ned group of people; second, it needs to show acertain amount of creative effort; and ﬁnally, itneeds to have been created outside of professionalroutines and practices. The ﬁrst condition excludescontent exchanged in e-mails or instant messages;the second, mere replications of already existingcontent (e.g., posting a copy of an existing newspa-\\nper article on a personal blog without any modiﬁ-\\ncations or commenting); and the third, all contentthat has been created with a commercial marketcontext in mind. While UGC has already beenavailable prior to Web 2.0, as discussed above,the combination of technological drivers (e.g.,increased broadband availability and hardwarecapacity), economic drivers (e.g., increased avail-\\nability of tools for the creation of UGC), and\\nsocial drivers (e.g., rise of a generation of‘‘digital natives’’ and ‘‘screenagers’’: younger agegroups with substantial technical knowledge andwillingness to engage online) make UGC nowadays\\nfundamentally different from what was observed inthe early 1980s. Based on these clariﬁcations of Web2.0 and UGC, it is now straightforward to give a more\\ndetailed deﬁnition of what we mean by Social Me-\\ndia. In our view– —and as used herein– —Social Media isa group of Internet-based applications that build onthe ideological and technological foundations ofWeb 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchangeof User Generated Content.\\nWithin this general deﬁnition, there are various\\ntypes of Social Media that need to be distinguished\\nfurther . However , although most people would prob-\\nably agree that Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, andSecond Life are all part of this large group, there is nosystematic way in which different Social Media ap-plications can be categorized. Also, new sites appearin cyberspace every day, so it is important that anyclassiﬁcation scheme takes into account applicationswhich may be forthcoming. To create such a classiﬁ-\\ncation scheme, and to do so in a systematic manner ,\\nwe rely on a set of theories in the ﬁeld of mediaresearch (social presence, media richness) and socialprocesses (self-presentation, self-disclosure), thetwo key elements of Social Media. Regarding themedia-related component of Social Media, socialpresence theory ( Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976 )\\nstates that media differ in the degree of ‘‘social\\npresence’’– —deﬁned as the acoustic, visual, and phys-\\nical contact that can be achieved– —they allow toemerge between two communication partners.Social presence is inﬂuenced by the intimacy (inter-personal vs. mediated) and immediacy (asynchronousvs. synchronous) of the medium, and can be expectedto be lower for mediated (e.g., telephone conversa-tion) than interpersonal (e.g., face-to-face discus-\\nsion) and for asynchronous (e.g., e-mail) than\\nsynchronous (e.g., live chat) communications. Thehigher the social presence, the larger the socialinﬂuence that the communication partners have oneach other’s behavior . Closely related to the idea ofsocial presence is the concept of media richness.Media richness theory ( Daft & Lengel, 1986 ) is based\\non the assumption that the goal of any communica-\\ntion is the resolution of ambiguity and the reduction\\nof uncertainty. It states that media differ in thedegree of richness they possess– —that is, the amountof information they allow to be transmitted in a giventime interval– —and that therefore some media aremore effective than others in resolving ambiguity anduncertainty. Applied to the context of Social Media,we assume that a ﬁrst classiﬁcation can be made\\nbased on the richness of the medium and the degree\\nof social presence it allows.\\nWith respect to the social dimension of Social\\nMedia, the concept of self-presentation states that\\nUsers of the world, unite!

On the one hand, this is\\ndone with the objective of inﬂuencing others to gain\\nrewards (e.g., make a positive impression on your\\nfuture in-laws); on the other hand, it is driven by awish to create an image that is consistent with one’spersonal identity (e.g., wearing a fashionable outﬁtin order to be perceived as young and trendy). Thekey reason why people decide to create a personalwebpage is, for example, the wish to present them-selves in cyberspace ( Schau & Gilly, 2003 ). Usually,\\nsuch a presentation is done through self-disclosure;\\nthat is, the conscious or unconscious revelation ofpersonal information (e.g., thoughts, feelings,likes, dislikes) that is consistent with the imageone would like to give. Self-disclosure is a criticalstep in the development of close relationships (e.g.,during dating) but can also occur between completestrangers; for example, when speaking about per-\\nsonal problems with the person seated next to you\\non an airplane. Applied to the context of SocialMedia, we assume that a second classiﬁcation canbe made based on the degree of self-disclosure itrequires and the type of self-presentation it allows.\\nCombining both dimensions leads to a classiﬁca-\\ntion of Social Media which we have visualized inTable 1 . With respect to social presence and media\\nrichness, applications such as collaborative projects\\n(e.g., Wikipedia) and blogs score lowest, as they areoften text-based and hence only allow for a rela-tively simple exchange. On the next level are con-tent communities (e.g., YouTube) and socialnetworking sites (e.g., Facebook) which, in additionto text-based communication, enable the sharing ofpictures, videos, and other forms of media. On the\\nhighest level are virtual game and social worlds\\n(e.g., World of Warcraft, Second Life), which tryto replicate all dimensions of face-to-face interac-tions in a virtual environment. Regarding self-pre-sentation and self-disclosure, blogs usually scorehigher than collaborative projects, as the lattertend to be focused on speciﬁc content domains.In a similar spirit, social networking sites allow\\nfor more self-disclosure than content communities.Finally, virtual social worlds require a higher level ofself-disclosure than virtual game worlds, as the\\nlatter are ruled by strict guidelines that force users\\nto behave in a certain way (e.g., as warriors in animaginary fantasy land). We will now provide moredetail on each of these six different types of SocialMedia, and discuss the challenges and opportunitiesthey offer companies.\\n3. The challenges and opportunities of\\nSocial Media\\n3.1. Collaborative projects\\nCollaborative projects enable the joint and simul-\\ntaneous creation of content by many end-users andare, in this sense, probably the most democratic\\nmanifestation of UGC. Within collaborative proj-\\nects, one differentiates between wikis– —that is,websites which allow users to add, remove, andchange text-based content– —and social bookmark-ing applications– —which enable the group-based col-lection and rating of Internet links or media content.Exemplary applications within this category includethe online encyclopedia Wikipedia, a wiki currently\\navailable in more than 230 different languages, and\\nthe social bookmarking web service Delicious, whichallows the storage and sharing of web bookmarks.The main idea underlying collaborative projects isthat the joint effort of many actors leads to a betteroutcome than any actor could achieve individually;this is similar to the efﬁcient-market hypothesis inbehavioral ﬁnance ( Fama, 1970 ). From a corporate\\nperspective, ﬁrms must be aware that collaborative\\nprojects are trending toward becoming the mainsource of information for many consumers. As such,although not everything written on Wikipedia mayactually be true, it is believed to be true by more\\nand more Internet users. This may be particularlycrucial as regards corporate crises. For example,62 A.M. Kaplan, M. Haenlein\\nTable 1. Classiﬁcation of Social Media by social presence/media richness and self-presentation/self-disclosure\\n', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='1b82ec01-ab5c-4e86-a3ad-b3cfeb1fae7f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '63', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='when online book retailer Amazon started to test\\nthe idea of dynamic pricing, comments declaringsuch a practice as unfair showed up instantaneouslyunder the Wikipedia entry on ‘‘time-based pricing.’’\\nYet, collaborative projects also provide some unique\\nopportunities for ﬁrms. Finnish handset manufac-turer Nokia, for instance, uses internal wikis toupdate employees on project status and to tradeideas, which are used by about 20% of its 68,000staff members. Likewise, American computer soft-ware company Adobe Systems maintains a list ofbookmarks to company-related websites and con-\\nversations on Delicious.\\n3.2. Blogs\\nBlogs, which represent the earliest form of Social\\nMedia, are special types of websites that usuallydisplay date-stamped entries in reverse chronologi-cal order ( OECD, 2007 ). They are the Social Media\\nequivalent of personal web pages and can come in a\\nmultitude of different variations, from personaldiaries describing the author’s life to summariesof all relevant information in one speciﬁc contentarea. Blogs are usually managed by one person only,but provide the possibility of interaction with othersthrough the addition of comments. Due to theirhistorical roots, text-based blogs are still by far\\nthe most common. Nevertheless, blogs have also\\nbegun to take different media formats. For exam-ple, San Francisco-based Justin.tv allows users tocreate personalized television channels via whichthey can broadcast images from their webcam inreal time to other users. Many companies are al-ready using blogs to update employees, customers,and shareholders on developments they consider to\\nbe important. Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Micro-\\nsystems, maintains a personal blog to improve thetransparency of his company; so does automotivegiant General Motors. Yet, as is the case with col-laborative projects, blogs do not come withoutrisks. These generally present in two fashions. First,customers who– —for one reason or another– —turnout to be dissatisﬁed with or disappointed by the\\ncompany’s offerings may decide to engage in virtual\\ncomplaints in the form of protest websites or blogs(Ward & Ostrom, 2006 ), which results in the avail-\\nability of potentially damaging information in onlinespace. Second, once ﬁrms encourage employees tobe active on blogs, they may need to live with theconsequences of staff members writing negativelyabout the ﬁrm. Microsoft’s former ‘‘technical evan-\\ngelist’’ Robert Scoble, for example, had a tendency\\nto ﬁercely criticize the products of his employer– —before he decided to leave the Redmond-basedsoftware company in 2006.3.3. Content communities\\nThe main objective of content communities is thesharing of media content between users. Content\\ncommunities exist for a wide range of different\\nmedia types, including text (e.g., BookCrossing,via which 750,000+ people from over 130countries share books), photos (e.g., Flickr), videos(e.g., YouTube), and PowerPoint presentations(e.g., Slideshare). Users on content communitiesare not required to create a personal proﬁle page;if they do, these pages usually only contain basic\\ninformation, such as the date they joined the com-\\nmunity and the number of videos shared. From acorporate viewpoint, content communities carrythe risk of being used as platforms for the sharingof copyright-protected materials. While major con-tent communities have rules in place to ban andremove such illegal content, it is difﬁcult to avoidpopular videos– —such as recent episodes of comedy\\ndramas– —being uploaded to YouTube only hours after\\nthey have been aired on television. On the positiveside, the high popularity of content communitiesmakes them a very attractive contact channel formany ﬁrms; this is easy to believe when one con-siders that YouTube serves over 100 million videosper day. In 2007, Procter & Gamble organized acontest for its over-the-counter drug Pepto-Bismol,\\nwhereby users were encouraged to upload to You-\\nTube 1-minute videos of themselves singing aboutthe ailments Pepto-Bismol counteracts, includingheartburn and nausea. In a similar spirit, kitchenappliances manufacturer Blendtec became popularfor its bevy of inexpensive ‘‘Will it blend?’’ videos,which have been watched by millions of people.Other ﬁrms, such as Cisco and Google, rely on\\ncontent communities to share recruiting videos,\\nas well as keynote speeches and press announce-ments, with their employees and investors.\\n3.4. Social networking sites\\nSocial networking sites are applications that enableusers to connect by creating personal information\\nproﬁles, inviting friends and colleagues to have\\naccess to those proﬁles, and sending e-mails andinstant messages between each other. These per-sonal proﬁles can include any type of information,including photos, video, audio ﬁles, and blogs. Ac-cording to Wikipedia, the largest social networkingsites are U.S.-based Facebook (initially founded byMark Zuckerberg to stay in touch with his fellow\\nstudents from Harvard University) and MySpace\\n(with 1,500 employees and more than 250 millionregistered users). Social networking sites are of suchhigh popularity, speciﬁcally among younger InternetUsers of the world, unite!

Several companies are\\nalready using social networking sites to support\\nthe creation of brand communities ( Muniz &\\nO’Guinn, 2001 ) or for marketing research in the\\ncontext of netnography ( Kozinets, 2002 ). To pro-\\nmote the movie ‘‘Fred Claus,’’ a 2007 Christmascomedy ﬁlm, Warner Brothers created a Facebookproﬁle via which visitors could watch trailers, down-load graphics, and play games. Likewise, the Adidas\\ncustom soccer community on MySpace allows visi-\\ntors to associate themselves with one of two brandsof elite soccer cleats produced by the German sportsapparel manufacturer, and to access product re-views and information on professional soccer play-ers who play using ‘‘their’’shoes. Some ﬁrms even goone step further and use Facebook as a distributionchannel. Consider U.S.-based ﬂorist 1-800-Flower-\\ns.com, which offers a widget on Facebook called\\n‘‘Gimme Love’’ whereby users can send ‘‘virtualbouquets’’ to friends or , with a click of the mouse,be directly transferred to the company’s website tosend real ﬂowers.\\n3.5. Virtual game worlds\\nVirtual worlds are platforms that replicate a three-dimensional environment in which users can appearin the form of personalized avatars and interact witheach other as they would in real life. In this sense,virtual worlds are probably the ultimate manifesta-tion of Social Media, as they provide the highestlevel of social presence and media richness of allapplications discussed thus far. Virtual worlds come\\nin two forms. The ﬁrst, virtual game worlds, require\\ntheir users to behave according to strict rules in thecontext of a massively multiplayer online role-play-ing game (MMORPG). These applications have gainedpopularity in recent years, as standard game con-soles– —such as Microsoft’s X-Box and Sony’s Play-Station– —now allow simultaneous play among amultitude of users around the globe. Examples of\\nvirtual game worlds include the cod-medieval\\n‘‘World of Warcraft,’’ which counts around 8.5 mil-lion subscribers who explore the virtual planet ofAzeroth in the form of humans, dwarves, orcs, ornight elves, to ﬁght monsters or to search for trea-sure; and Sony’s EverQuest, in which 16 differentraces of players (e.g., wizards, clerics) travel thefantasy world of Norrath. The rules of such games\\nusually limit the degree of self-presentation and\\nself-disclosure possible, although some users spendso much time with these applications that theircharacter– —be it a warrior , a wizard, or a dragonhunter– —starts to more and more closely resemble\\ntheir real life personality. Besides their use for in-game advertising (similar in idea to productplacement in blockbuster movies), the high popu-\\nlarity of virtual game worlds can also be leveraged\\nin more traditional communication campaigns.Japanese automotive giant Toyota, for example,used pictures and mechanics from the World ofWarcraft application in its latest Tundra commercialto reach the 2.5 million players in the U.S. alone.\\n3.6. Virtual social worlds\\nThe second group of virtual worlds, often referred toas virtual social worlds, allows inhabitants to choosetheir behavior more freely and essentially live avirtual life similar to their real life. As in virtual gameworlds, virtual social world users appear in the formof avatars and interact in a three-dimensional virtualenvironment; however , in this realm, there are no\\nrules restricting the range of possible interactions,\\nexcept for basic physical laws such as gravity. Thisallows for an unlimited range of self presentationstrategies, and it has been shown that with increasingusage intensity and consumption experience, users ofvirtual social worlds– —or ‘‘residents,’’ as they preferto be called– —show behavior that more and moreclosely mirrors the one observed in real life settings\\n(Haenlein & Kaplan, 2009; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2009a,\\n2009b ). Arguably, the most prominent example of\\nvirtual social worlds is the Second Life application,founded and managed by the San Francisco-basedcompany Linden Research Inc. Besides doing every-thing that is possible in real life (e.g., speaking toother avatars, taking a walk, enjoying the virtualsunshine), Second Life also allows users to create\\ncontent (e.g., to design virtual clothing or furniture\\nitems) and to sell this content to others in exchangefor Linden Dollars, a virtual currency traded againstthe U.S. Dollar on the Second Life Exchange.Some residents are so successful in this task thatthe virtual money earned that way complementstheir real life income.

Next, we provide such a set of recom-\\nmendations. Given that Social Media have both asocial- and a media-component, we split our adviceinto two sections: ﬁve points about using media andﬁve points about being social.\\n4.1. Five points about using media\\n4.1.1. Choose carefullyThere are dozens– —if not hundreds– —of Social Mediaapplications, and new ones are appearing on thehorizon every day. If you still need time to run yourcore business, you simply cannot participate in themall, especially since ‘‘being active’’ is one key re-quirement of success (see below). Choosing theright medium for any given purpose depends on\\nthe target group to be reached and the message\\nto be communicated. On the one hand, each SocialMedia application usually attracts a certain group ofpeople and ﬁrms should be active wherever theircustomers are present. For example, if your maintarget audience is book lovers, a content communityvia which users share self-written novels or poems islikely better suited to your purpose than a virtual\\nworld which centers on ﬁghting dragons and ﬁnding\\ntreasures. On the other hand, there may be situa-tions whereby certain features are necessary toensure effective communication, and these featuresare only offered by one speciﬁc application. Forexample, when the U.S. Army undertook an initia-tive in 2007 to reach the Hispanic community,it decided to utilize the social networking site\\nUnivision rather than the more popular Facebook.\\nThis choice was driven in part by the fact thatUnivision– —a Spanish-language television networkin the U.S. and Puerto Rico– —is the social networkingapplication with the largest Latin American audi-ence, due to an extensive range of telenovelas andMexican programs produced by Grupo Televisa.However, another reason Univision was chosen is\\nbecause it offers a moderating service which checks\\ncomments from users for appropriateness beforeposting them on the site. In contrast, other appli-cations, including Facebook, allow users to postmessages without supervision.\\n4.1.2. Pick the application, or make your own\\nOnce you know which game you’re playing, the next\\ndecision involves whether to make or buy. In some\\ncases, it might just be best to join an existing SocialMedia application and beneﬁt from its popularityand user base. After all, there is no need to reinventthe wheel if somebody has already done it, espe-\\ncially given that Social Media show positive networkexternalities in the sense that they get more attrac-tive to join the more participants they already have.\\nBut in some cases, the right application might just\\nnot be available yet. Japan’s Fujiﬁlm, for example,recently launched its own social network to build acommunity of photo enthusiasts. In a similar spirit,U.S.-based department store ﬁrm Sears collaborat-ed with MTV music television to create a socialnetwork around back-to-school shopping. Yet, what-ever the ultimate decision– —to buy, make, or both– —\\nit is vital that there is an understanding of the basic\\nidea behind Social Media. It’s all about participa-tion, sharing, and collaboration, rather thanstraightforward advertising and selling.\\n4.1.3. Ensure activity alignment\\nSometimes you may decide to rely on various SocialMedia, or a set of different applications within the\\nsame group, in order to have the largest possible\\nreach. In this case, it is crucial to ensure that yourSocial Media activities are all aligned with eachother. A prime example in this context is computermanufacturer Dell and its ‘‘Digital Nomads’’ cam-paign. Dell uses a combination of social networkingsites (Facebook, LinkedIn), blogs, and content com-munities (YouTube videos) to show how its range of\\nlaptop computers enable individuals to become a\\nnomadic mobile workforce. In a similar spirit, Chrys-ler’s Jeep brand connects with its customers bycombining photos shared on the content communityFlickr, with groups on social networking sites such asMySpace and Facebook. Using different contactchannels can be a worthwhile and proﬁtable strate-gy. But remember: one goal of communication is the\\nresolution of ambiguity and reduction of uncertain-\\nty, and nothing is more confusing than contradictingmessages across different channels.\\n4.1.4. Media plan integration\\nWhat is true for different types of Social Media alsoholds for the relationship between Social Media andtraditional media: Integration is key! While you may\\nconsider these two arenas to be completely differ-\\nent, in customers’ eyes they are both part of thesame: your corporate image. Consider the actions ofsoft drink giant Coca-Cola. In June 2006, a pair ofperformance artists shot a video featuring a series ofgeysers they created by dropping Mentos brandmints into 2-liter bottles of Coke; the clip becamea major hit on YouTube. Realizing customers’ enthu-\\nsiasm for this performance, Coca-Cola fostered the\\nsensation by airing the video on late-night televisionand ensuring broad digital distribution across differ-ent content communities.

Access for all\\nAlthough this might sound elementary, once the ﬁrm\\nhas decided to utilize Social Media applications, it isworth checking that all employees may actuallyaccess them. Commonly, ﬁrms block Facebook,YouTube, and Second Life on corporate PCs for fearthat staff might spend too much time networkinginstead of working. While this is certainly a consid-eration, it cannot imply that employees must have\\nspecial permission to be able to access the company\\nblog. At the same time, there is a need to curtail thepossibility of the entire organization spending all itstime producing funny videos and uploading them toYouTube. One possible approach involves deﬁninggroups of employees whose primary objective is themanagement of corporate Social Media; all otherstaff members are treated as occasional partici-\\npants. Under this scenario, the ﬁrst group is given\\nadministrator rights– —which allows the opening ofnew discussion threads and deletion of inappropri-ate posts– —while the second group is not. Also, atsome point, it will be necessary to develop certainguidelines for Social Media usage; as done, forinstance, by ‘‘Big Blue’’ IBM, which has a corporatecharta for appropriate behavior within Second Life.\\nFor example, it is important to highlight that every\\nemployee needs to identify himself or herself assuch when posting a comment on the corporateblog. Otherwise, end-consumers could get theimpression that anonymous accounts are used toenable employees to post fake messages and over-ly-positive feedback, which could severely damagethe credibility of your whole Social Media campaign.\\n4.2. Five points about being social\\n4.2.1. Be activeIf you want to develop a relationship with someone,it is always advisable to take the lead and to beactive. Social Media are all about sharing and inter-action, so ensure that your content is always fresh\\nand that you engage in discussions with your cus-\\ntomers. Consider the aforementioned blog kept bySun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz. Via thisoutlet, the ﬁgurehead discusses– —on an ongoingbasis– —his corporate strategy, new product develop-ment projects, and company values, and repliesdirectly to correspondence received. In consideringyour Social Media efforts, be aware that ﬁrm in-\\nvolvement must extend beyond responding to neg-\\native comments and defending product offerings.Social Media is less about explaining why your bakingmix, detergent, or shampoo is better than anyoneelse’s than it is about engaging others in open and\\nactive conversation. Participants on Social Mediaapplications have the desire to actively engageand to become both producers and consumers of\\ninformation, so-called ‘‘prosumers’’ ( Tofﬂer , 1980 ).\\nBe considerate of this need and act accordingly.\\n4.2.2. Be interesting\\nLet’s face it: nobody is interested in speaking to aboring person. As such, if you would like your cus-tomers to engage with you, you need to give them areason for doing so– —one which extends beyond\\nsaying you are the best airline in town, or manufac-\\nture the most robust kitchen blender. The ﬁrst stepis to listen to your customers. Find out what they\\nwould like to hear; what they would like to talk\\nabout; what they might ﬁnd interesting, enjoyable,\\nand valuable. Then, develop and post content thatﬁts those expectations. Coffee powerhouse Star-bucks, for example, created the ‘‘My Starbucks\\nIdea’’ platform, via which customers can submit\\nnew ideas for the company. These ideas are subse-quently voted on by other users, with the winnersbeing considered for implementation by Starbuckstop management. As stated by Oscar Wilde in hisnovel, The Picture of Dorian Grey : The one sin for\\nwhich there is no forgiveness is ennui.\\n4.2.3. Be humble\\nNever forget that Social Media existed before youdecided to engage in them; indeed, in many cases,even before you knew about their existence. In thislight, do not expect that you know better how to usethem than others who have spent countless hours onFacebook or Second Life, for example. Before youenter any application, ﬁrst take some time to dis-\\ncover it and to learn about its history and basic\\nrules. Only once you have gained the necessaryunderstanding, start to participate. When aero-space and defense ﬁrm Boeing decided to launchits ﬁrst corporate blog, the site was designed suchthat users were not allowed to comment on whatthey saw. Yet, interaction and feedback are criticalelements of all Social Media, blogs included. Hence,\\nmany readers perceived the Boeing blog as a fake,\\nand simply corporate advertising in disguise. If thereis one certain path to failure, it involves thinkingthat Social Media is just about posting existing TVspots on YouTube or putting prefabricated pressannouncements on corporate blogs.\\n4.2.4. Be unprofessional\\nHave you ever noticed that in Hollywood blockbust-\\ner ﬁlms, it’s not usually the handsome guy who endsup with the girl, but rather the clumsy, charmingone? The same goes for Social Media, and ﬁrms66 A.M. Kaplan, M. Haenlein', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='fb329b76-b731-4f1e-841c-2a52543e37dd', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '67', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='would be wise to avoid overly-professional content\\nofferings. There’s no need to spend $100,000 todesign the perfect MySpace presence, or hire aprofessional writer to manage your corporate blog.\\nInstead, try to blend in with other users and don’t be\\nafraid to make mistakes! Bill Marriott, Chairman andCEO of the Marriott International Hotel chain, useshis blog, for example, to post regular updates andstories from his travels to Marriott properties aroundthe world– —very much in the same way as would awork colleague when describing her last vacation.Social Media users are people like you, who under-\\nstand that things do not always go smoothly. And, if\\nyou’re nice to them, they may even give you freeadvice on how to do it better the next time.\\n4.2.5. Be honest\\nLast but not least, be honest and respect the rules ofthe game. Some Social Media– —such as Wikipedia– —may not allow companies to be involved, so do not\\ntry to force your way in. Consider Anheuser-Busch,\\nowner of SeaWorld marine mammal parks. Anheus-er-Busch tried to ‘‘rectify’’ misleading informationon Wikipedia through the use of PR ﬁrms, and failedmiserably at it. Never expect that other participantsmay not ﬁnd out who stands behind some anonymoususer account; after all, you’re dealing with some ofthe most technologically sophisticated people on\\nthe planet.\\n5. Nothing to lose but their chains\\nToday, everything is about Social Media. Some in-\\ndustry gurus claim that if you do not participate inFacebook, YouTube, and Second Life, you are not\\npart of cyberspace anymore. Social Media allow\\nﬁrms to engage in timely and direct end-consumercontact at relatively low cost and higher levels ofefﬁciency than can be achieved with more tradi-tional communication tools. This makes Social Medianot only relevant for large multinational ﬁrms, butalso for small and medium sized companies, andeven nonproﬁt and governmental agencies. Using\\nSocial Media is not an easy task and may require new\\nways of thinking, but the potential gains are far frombeing negligible. Dell, for example, states that itsuse of T witter– —a micro blogging application thatallows sending out short, text-based posts of 140characters or less– —has generated $1 million in in-cremental revenue due to sales alerts. Some ﬁrmsmay even be too successful for their own good, as\\nillustrated by Burger King’s ‘‘Whopper Sacriﬁce’’\\ncampaign: In December 2008, the fast food giantdeveloped a Facebook application which gave usersa free Whopper sandwich for every 10 friends theydeleted from their Facebook network. The cam-\\npaign was adopted by over 20,000 users, resultingin the sacriﬁcing of 233,906 friends in exchange forfree burgers. Only one month later , in January 2009,\\nFacebook shut down Whopper Sacriﬁce, citing pri-\\nvacy concerns. Who would have thought that theprice of a friendship is less than $2 a dozen?\\nA new trend is on the horizon, though; Watch out\\nfor Mobile Social Media! Mobile Web 2.0 is very similarto Web 2.0, as discussed earlier. In contrast to itspredecessor Mobile Web 1.0, which relied on propri-etary protocols (e.g., WAP) and use-based pricing,\\nMobile Web 2.0 is characterized by open standards\\n(e.g., a transition to the TCP/IP protocol, the tech-nical foundation of the World Wide Web) and ﬂat-ratesystems. Even the manual entry of web addressesusing small and difﬁcult-to-handle keyboards isbecoming history. Soon, all items around you willbe equipped with Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation(RFID) tags that will be able to automatically connect\\nto your mobile phone and send URLs to them, similar\\nto today’s text messages. This technical evolution islaying the groundwork for moving Social Media ap-plications away from desktop PCs and laptops, to-ward mobile devices. Why log into Facebook if youcan easily update all your friends using T witter? Whywait until you return home to watch the new YouT ubevideo if you can do so conveniently on your iPhone?\\nAccording to Jupiter Research, the market for\\nMobile Web 2.0 evolutions will grow from a mere$5.5 billion today to an impressive $22.4 billion by2013. Mobile Social Media applications are expectedto be the main driver of this evolution, soon ac-counting for over 50% of the market. In one way, thissurge toward Mobile Social Media can even be seenas another step toward Internet democratization\\nand closing the digital divide between developed\\nand emerging countries. In India, for example, mo-bile phones outnumber PCs by 10 to 1. In Thailand,only 13% of the population owns a computer , versus82% who have access to a mobile phone. It is there-fore not surprising that the Pew Research Center– —aWashington-based think tank– —estimates that by2020, a mobile device will be the primary Internet\\nconnection tool for most people in the world. Making\\nSocial Media applications mobile is likely to tap acurrently unexploited base of new users. Even if per-capita spending in these countries may still be low,vast population numbers make them relevant forvirtually any ﬁrm.\\nObviously, Mobile Social Media does not come\\nwithout a price. Some would argue that while it\\nenables the detailed following of friends half-way\\nacross the world, it can foster a society wherewe don’t know the names of our own next-doorneighbors.

Some recent epidemiological data seem to support the view that many\\nsegments of the adult population have chronically inadequate sleep. On the otherhand, some experts have claimed that our core, basic amount of sleep is around 6 hper night, and that the rest of our sleep can be easily curtailed, being unnecessaryto fulﬁll any sleep need. However, experimental data on the effects of both acuteand cumulative partial sleep deprivation (PSD) consistently point out that sleeprestriction has substantial negative effects on sleepiness, motor and cognitive per-formance and mood, as well as on some metabolic, hormonal and immunologicalvariables. As chronic PSD may have serious long-term adverse health effects, it shouldbe avoided in the general population. In the short-term, the effects of sleep curtailmentseem to accumulate linearly, while the effects of long-term PSD should be furtherinvestigated, as the few available studies are ﬂawed by methodological weaknesses.On the other hand, there is evidence that extending sleep by 2–3 h beyond the normproduces only marginal beneﬁts for an average individual. Finally, it is underlined that,as large individual differences do exist in the need for sleep, the search for thesleep\\nneed may be vain.

Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based andﬁne-tuning . The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning allpre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the maskedarXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='a9130bcc-8246-449b-94f8-11d08c1f687d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\\nels are available at https://github.com/\\ngoogle-research/bert .\\n2 Related Work\\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\\nguage representations, and we brieﬂy review the\\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\\nLearning widely applicable representations of\\nwords has been an active area of research for\\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\\n2014) methods. Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).\\nMore recently, sentence or document encoders\\nwhich produce contextual token representations\\nhave been pre-trained from unlabeled text and\\nﬁne-tuned for a supervised downstream task (Dai\\nand Le, 2015; Howard and Ruder, 2018; Radford\\net al., 2018). The advantage of these approaches\\nis that few parameters need to be learned from\\nscratch. At least partly due to this advantage,\\nOpenAI GPT (Radford et al., 2018) achieved pre-\\nviously state-of-the-art results on many sentence-\\nlevel tasks from the GLUE benchmark (Wang\\net al., 2018a).

The same pre-trained model parameters are used to initialize\\nmodels for different down-stream tasks. During ﬁne-tuning, all parameters are ﬁne-tuned. [CLS] is a special\\nsymbol added in front of every input example, and [SEP] is a special separator token (e.g. separating ques-\\ntions/answers).\\ning and auto-encoder objectives have been used\\nfor pre-training such models (Howard and Ruder,\\n2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dai and Le, 2015).\\n2.3 Transfer Learning from Supervised Data\\nThere has also been work showing effective trans-\\nfer from supervised tasks with large datasets, such\\nas natural language inference (Conneau et al.,\\n2017) and machine translation (McCann et al.,\\n2017). Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al. (2017) and released in\\nthetensor2tensor library.1Because the use\\nof Transformers has become common and our im-\\nplementation is almost identical to the original,\\nwe will omit an exhaustive background descrip-\\ntion of the model architecture and refer readers to\\nVaswani et al. (2017) as well as excellent guides\\nsuch as “The Annotated Transformer.”2\\nIn this work, we denote the number of layers\\n(i.e., Transformer blocks) as L, the hidden size as\\nH, and the number of self-attention heads as A.3\\nWe primarily report results on two model sizes:\\nBERT BASE (L=12, H=768, A=12, Total Param-\\neters=110M) and BERT LARGE (L=24, H=1024,\\nA=16, Total Parameters=340M).\\nBERT BASE was chosen to have the same model\\nsize as OpenAI GPT for comparison purposes.\\nCritically, however, the BERT Transformer uses\\nbidirectional self-attention, while the GPT Trans-\\nformer uses constrained self-attention where every\\ntoken can only attend to context to its left.4\\n1https://github.com/tensorﬂow/tensor2tensor\\n2http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html\\n3In all cases we set the feed-forward/ﬁlter size to be 4H,\\ni.e., 3072 for the H= 768 and 4096 for the H= 1024 .\\n4We note that in the literature the bidirectional Trans-', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='f74c0c2a-9c16-4f6e-8a0a-22edbe9aed2a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='Input/Output Representations To make BERT\\nhandle a variety of down-stream tasks, our input\\nrepresentation is able to unambiguously represent\\nboth a single sentence and a pair of sentences\\n(e.g.,⟨Question, Answer⟩) in one token sequence.\\nThroughout this work, a “sentence” can be an arbi-\\ntrary span of contiguous text, rather than an actual\\nlinguistic sentence. A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS] ). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\\nasTi∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right orright-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.In order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual[MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time. Then,\\nTiwill be used to predict the original token with\\ncross entropy loss. We compare variations of this\\nprocedure in Appendix C.2.\\nTask #2: Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)\\nMany important downstream tasks such as Ques-\\ntion Answering (QA) and Natural Language Infer-\\nence (NLI) are based on understanding the rela-\\ntionship between two sentences, which is not di-\\nrectly captured by language modeling. In order\\nto train a model that understands sentence rela-\\ntionships, we pre-train for a binarized next sen-\\ntence prediction task that can be trivially gener-\\nated from any monolingual corpus. Speciﬁcally,\\nwhen choosing the sentences AandBfor each pre-\\ntraining example, 50% of the time Bis the actual\\nnext sentence that follows A(labeled as IsNext ),\\nand 50% of the time it is a random sentence from\\nthe corpus (labeled as NotNext ). As we show\\nin Figure 1, Cis used for next sentence predic-\\ntion (NSP).5Despite its simplicity, we demon-\\nstrate in Section 5.1 that pre-training towards this\\ntask is very beneﬁcial to both QA and NLI.6\\n5The ﬁnal model achieves 97%-98% accuracy on NSP.\\n6The vector Cis not a meaningful sentence representation\\nwithout ﬁne-tuning, since it was trained with NSP.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='21295485-42f7-4d81-acfe-067fc9821f0e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='[CLS] helikesplay## ing[SEP] mydogiscute[SEP]Input \\nE[CLS] Ehe Elikes Eplay E## ing E[SEP] Emy Edog Eis Ecute E[SEP] Token \\nEmbeddings \\nEA EB EB EB EB EB EA EA EA EA EASegment \\nEmbeddings \\nE0 E6 E7 E8 E9 E10 E1 E2 E3 E4 E5Position \\nEmbeddings Figure 2: BERT input representation. The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ∅pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks. Detailed descriptions of GLUE datasets are\\nincluded in Appendix B.1.\\nTo ﬁne-tune on GLUE, we represent the input\\nsequence (for single sentence or sentence pairs)\\nas described in Section 3, and use the ﬁnal hid-\\nden vectorC∈RHcorresponding to the ﬁrst\\ninput token ( [CLS] ) as the aggregate representa-\\ntion. The only new parameters introduced during\\nﬁne-tuning are classiﬁcation layer weights W∈\\nRK×H, whereKis the number of labels. We com-\\npute a standard classiﬁcation loss with CandW,\\ni.e.,log(softmax( CWT)).\\n7For example, the BERT SQuAD model can be trained in\\naround 30 minutes on a single Cloud TPU to achieve a Dev\\nF1 score of 91.0%.\\n8See (10) in https://gluebenchmark.com/faq .', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='1487f38a-f343-456d-8b33-6bcadadc1576', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='System MNLI-(m/mm) QQP QNLI SST-2 CoLA STS-B MRPC RTE Average\\n392k 363k 108k 67k 8.5k 5.7k 3.5k 2.5k -\\nPre-OpenAI SOTA 80.6/80.1 66.1 82.3 93.2 35.0 81.0 86.0 61.7 74.0\\nBiLSTM+ELMo+Attn 76.4/76.1 64.8 79.8 90.4 36.0 73.3 84.9 56.8 71.0\\nOpenAI GPT 82.1/81.4 70.3 87.4 91.3 45.4 80.0 82.3 56.0 75.1\\nBERT BASE 84.6/83.4 71.2 90.5 93.5 52.1 85.8 88.9 66.4 79.6\\nBERT LARGE 86.7/85.9 72.1 92.7 94.9 60.5 86.5 89.3 70.1 82.1\\nTable 1: GLUE Test results, scored by the evaluation server ( https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard ).\\nThe number below each task denotes the number of training examples.

We only introduce a start vec-\\ntorS∈RHand an end vector E∈RHduring\\nﬁne-tuning. The probability of word ibeing the\\nstart of the answer span is computed as a dot prod-\\nuct between TiandSfollowed by a softmax over\\nall of the words in the paragraph: Pi=eS·Ti∑\\njeS·Tj.\\nThe analogous formula is used for the end of the\\nanswer span.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy. We trained a number\\nof BERT models with a differing number of layers,\\nhidden units, and attention heads, while otherwise\\nusing the same hyperparameters and training pro-\\ncedure as described previously.\\nResults on selected GLUE tasks are shown in\\nTable 6. In this table, we report the average Dev\\nSet accuracy from 5 random restarts of ﬁne-tuning.\\nWe can see that larger models lead to a strict ac-\\ncuracy improvement across all four datasets, even\\nfor MRPC which only has 3,600 labeled train-\\ning examples, and is substantially different from\\nthe pre-training tasks. It is also perhaps surpris-\\ning that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant\\nimprovements on top of models which are al-\\nready quite large relative to the existing literature.\\nFor example, the largest Transformer explored in\\nVaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)\\nwith 100M parameters for the encoder, and the\\nlargest Transformer we have found in the literature\\nis (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters\\n(Al-Rfou et al., 2018). By contrast, BERT BASE\\ncontains 110M parameters and BERT LARGE con-\\ntains 340M parameters.\\nIt has long been known that increasing the\\nmodel size will lead to continual improvements\\non large-scale tasks such as machine translation\\nand language modeling, which is demonstrated\\nby the LM perplexity of held-out training data\\nshown in Table 6. However, we believe that\\nthis is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-\\ningly that scaling to extreme model sizes also\\nleads to large improvements on very small scale\\ntasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-\\nciently pre-trained.

(2016) men-\\ntioned in passing that increasing hidden dimen-\\nsion size from 200 to 600 helped, but increasing\\nfurther to 1,000 did not bring further improve-\\nments. Both of these prior works used a feature-\\nbased approach — we hypothesize that when the\\nmodel is ﬁne-tuned directly on the downstream\\ntasks and uses only a very small number of ran-\\ndomly initialized additional parameters, the task-\\nspeciﬁc models can beneﬁt from the larger, more\\nexpressive pre-trained representations even when\\ndownstream task data is very small.\\n5.3 Feature-based Approach with BERT\\nAll of the BERT results presented so far have used\\nthe ﬁne-tuning approach, where a simple classiﬁ-\\ncation layer is added to the pre-trained model, and\\nall parameters are jointly ﬁne-tuned on a down-\\nstream task. However, the feature-based approach,\\nwhere ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-\\ntrained model, has certain advantages. First, not\\nall tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-\\nformer encoder architecture, and therefore require\\na task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added.\\nSecond, there are major computational beneﬁts\\nto pre-compute an expensive representation of the\\ntraining data once and then run many experiments\\nwith cheaper models on top of this representation.\\nIn this section, we compare the two approaches\\nby applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named\\nEntity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang\\nand De Meulder, 2003).

We use the representation of\\nthe ﬁrst sub-token as the input to the token-level\\nclassiﬁer over the NER label set.\\nTo ablate the ﬁne-tuning approach, we apply the\\nfeature-based approach by extracting the activa-\\ntions from one or more layers without ﬁne-tuning\\nany parameters of BERT. These contextual em-\\nbeddings are used as input to a randomly initial-\\nized two-layer 768-dimensional BiLSTM before\\nthe classiﬁcation layer.\\nResults are presented in Table 7.

This\\ndemonstrates that BERT is effective for both ﬁne-\\ntuning and feature-based approaches.\\n6 Conclusion\\nRecent empirical improvements due to transfer\\nlearning with language models have demonstrated\\nthat rich, unsupervised pre-training is an integral\\npart of many language understanding systems. In\\nparticular, these results enable even low-resource\\ntasks to beneﬁt from deep unidirectional architec-\\ntures.

The purpose of this is to bias the\\nrepresentation towards the actual observed\\nword.\\nThe advantage of this procedure is that the\\nTransformer encoder does not know which words\\nit will be asked to predict or which have been re-\\nplaced by random words, so it is forced to keep\\na distributional contextual representation of ev-\\neryinput token. Additionally, because random\\nreplacement only occurs for 1.5% of all tokens\\n(i.e., 10% of 15%), this does not seem to harm\\nthe model’s language understanding capability. In\\nSection C.2, we evaluate the impact this proce-\\ndure.\\nCompared to standard langauge model training,\\nthe masked LM only make predictions on 15% of\\ntokens in each batch, which suggests that more\\npre-training steps may be required for the model', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='d783737a-cfe0-46dd-b878-0e543cbdbcd7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='BERT (Ours) \\nTrm Trm Trm\\nTrm Trm Trm...\\n...Trm Trm Trm\\nTrm Trm Trm...\\n...OpenAI GPT \\nLstm ELMo \\nLstm Lstm \\nLstm Lstm Lstm Lstm Lstm Lstm \\nLstm Lstm Lstm  T1 T2 TN...\\n...\\n......\\n...\\n E1 E2 EN...

In Section C.1 we demonstrate that\\nMLM does converge marginally slower than a left-\\nto-right model (which predicts every token), but\\nthe empirical improvements of the MLM model\\nfar outweigh the increased training cost.\\nNext Sentence Prediction The next sentence\\nprediction task can be illustrated in the following\\nexamples.\\nInput =[CLS] the man went to [MASK] store [SEP]\\nhe bought a gallon [MASK] milk [SEP]\\nLabel =IsNext\\nInput =[CLS] the man [MASK] to the store [SEP]\\npenguin [MASK] are flight ##less birds [SEP]\\nLabel =NotNext\\nA.2 Pre-training Procedure\\nTo generate each training input sequence, we sam-\\nple two spans of text from the corpus, which we\\nrefer to as “sentences” even though they are typ-\\nically much longer than single sentences (but can\\nbe shorter also). The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the Bembed-\\nding. 50% of the time Bis the actual next sentence\\nthat follows Aand 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is≤512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40epochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1= 0.9,\\nβ2= 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu , following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13Training of BERT LARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs. The dropout probability was always\\nkept at 0.1. The optimal hyperparameter values\\nare task-speciﬁc, but we found the following range\\nof possible values to work well across all tasks:\\n•Batch size : 16, 32\\n13https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2018/06/Cloud-\\nTPU-now-offers-preemptible-pricing-and-global-\\navailability.html', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='beee139c-669b-4930-9178-5118bb0977ea', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='•Learning rate (Adam) : 5e-5, 3e-5, 2e-5\\n•Number of epochs : 2, 3, 4\\nWe also observed that large data sets (e.g.,\\n100k+ labeled training examples) were far less\\nsensitive to hyperparameter choice than small data\\nsets. Fine-tuning is typically very fast, so it is rea-\\nsonable to simply run an exhaustive search over\\nthe above parameters and choose the model that\\nperforms best on the development set.\\nA.4 Comparison of BERT, ELMo ,and\\nOpenAI GPT\\nHere we studies the differences in recent popular\\nrepresentation learning models including ELMo,\\nOpenAI GPT and BERT. The comparisons be-\\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A/Bembed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

Question: Does BERT really need such\\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\\nhigh ﬁne-tuning accuracy?\\nAnswer: Yes, BERT BASE achieves almost\\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\\n2. Question: Does MLM pre-training converge\\nslower than LTR pre-training, since only 15%\\nof words are predicted in each batch rather\\nthan every word?\\nAnswer: The MLM model does converge\\nslightly slower than the LTR model. How-\\never, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM\\nmodel begins to outperform the LTR model\\nalmost immediately.\\nC.2 Ablation for Different Masking\\nProcedures\\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a\\nmixed strategy for masking the target tokens when\\npre-training with the masked language model\\n(MLM) objective.

We report the\\nDev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER,\\nwe report both ﬁne-tuning and feature-based ap-\\nproaches, as we expect the mismatch will be am-\\npliﬁed for the feature-based approach as the model\\nwill not have the chance to adjust the representa-\\ntions.\\nMasking Rates Dev Set Results\\nMASK SAME RND MNLI NER\\nFine-tune Fine-tune Feature-based\\n80% 10% 10% 84.2 95.4 94.9\\n100% 0% 0% 84.3 94.9 94.0\\n80% 0% 20% 84.1 95.2 94.6\\n80% 20% 0% 84.4 95.2 94.7\\n0% 20% 80% 83.7 94.8 94.6\\n0% 0% 100% 83.6 94.9 94.6\\nTable 8: Ablation over different masking strategies.\\nThe results are presented in Table 8.

this paper is to determine if preconditioning the SDF-1/CXCR4 (Stromal\\n \\nCell-derived Factor 1/ Chemokine Receptor 4) axis to attract more MSCs (Mesenchymal Stem\\n \\nCells) to the site of injury in OA (Osteoarthritis) is as viable as completely blockading the axis.\\n \\nFor this reason, a systematic review of existing research allowed for a grounded theory method\\n \\nto be employed. The reviewed studies were separated into 3 groups. The blockade group\\n \\ndisplayed the use of T140 and AMD3100 as the primary inhibitors of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.\\n \\nThe control group displayed the effects of unaided MSC homing in OA, serving as a bridge\\n \\nbetween the two extremes of the field. Finally, the preconditioned group considered upregulating\\n \\nSDF-1/CXCR4 expression through scaffolding, pharmacological agents, genetic modification,\\n \\nand magnetic guidance, which would increase the attraction of MSCs that can assist in the\\n \\nregeneration process of the injury. Three criteria were developed to comparatively assess the\\n \\nblockade group to the preconditioned group: Type II Collagen, MMP-13, and the scores used to\\n \\nassess cartilage repair. Results indicated similarities between the blockade group and the\\n \\npreconditioning group, suggesting that the use of preconditioning methods on MSCs to enhance\\n \\nthe interaction between SDF-1 and CXCR4 can be as viable as inhibiting the pathway.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3701998b-c898-4666-8f1b-297fd1b3a8e4', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'AP Research 3.35 (1).pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/AP Research 3.35 (1).pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 186447, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='5\\n \\n \\nIntroduction\\n \\nOsteoarthritis\\n \\nAccording to the World Health Organization, more than 150 million people suffer from\\n \\nosteoarthritis globally\\n\\u200b\\n1\\n\\u200b\\n - in the United States, over 30 million people are diagnosed with the\\n \\ndisease.\\n\\u200b\\n2\\n\\u200b\\n Osteoarthritis (OA) is a “wear and tear” degenerative disease that develops due to\\n \\nrepetitive stress on joints in the knee, hip, finger, or spine.

A systematic review of the existing\\n \\nliterature was conducted using the aforementioned grounded theory approach.\\n \\n \\nAn in-depth review of peer-reviewed articles and medical journals pertaining to the\\n \\nobservation of unaided SDF-1/CXCR4 signalling and the blockade of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis\\n \\nwas conducted. After analyzing the sources, I separated them into different groups. First, I\\n \\nselected 3 major studies that had relevance in the field of inhibiting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. The\\n \\nfindings of Bragg \\n\\u200b\\net al.\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n15\\n\\u200b\\n Wei \\n\\u200b\\net al.\\n\\u200b\\n,\\n\\u200b\\n16\\n\\u200b\\n and Kun Wang \\n\\u200b\\net al.\\n\\u200b\\n17\\n\\u200b\\n fit this group and were used to\\n \\nobtain data in regards to blockading the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. Through a thorough assessment, it\\n \\nwas established that I would consider the use of T140 and AMD3100 as the primary CXCR4\\n \\nantagonists. The second group was in regards to SDF-1/CXCR4 in OA: Shen \\n\\u200b\\net al.\\n\\u200b\\n19\\n\\u200b\\n and Yuze\\n \\nWang \\n\\u200b\\net al.\\n\\u200b\\n20\\n\\u200b\\n were the two main studies used to determine the effects of unaided MSC homing in\\n \\nOA. These two studies provided me data that was established as a control and as a bridge\\n \\nbetween the two extremes of the field.

However, the third group of research did not\\n \\nmention the effectiveness in an OA model, which is where my research was applied.\\n \\nTo organize the data I collected from the third group, I further categorized information\\n \\ninto the following criteria: Coll-II, MMP-13, and the scores used to assess cartilage repair.\\n \\nThrough this method of organization, I identified the implications and limitations of hindering\\n \\nthe SDF-1/CXCR4 axis and promoting the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis, allowing for a rich discussion of\\n \\nwhen their uses would be deemed appropriate.

Gathercole\\nCentre for the Study of Memory and Learning, University of Bristol, U.K.\\nThis article reviews recent advances in understanding the changes in memory function that\\ntake place during the childhood years. Development of the following aspects of memory areconsidered: short-term memory, comprising phonological memory, visuospatial memory,and executive function; autobiographical memory; episodic memory, including eyewitnessmemory; and metamemory. Each of these aspects of memory function shows substantialqualitative change from infancy, through the preschool period, to the early school years.Beyond about 7 years of age, however, memory function appears adult-like in organisationand strategies, and shows only a gradual quantitative improvement through to earlyadolescence.\\nKeywords: Memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, autobiographical memory,\\nepisodic memory, eyewitness testimony.\\nAbbreviations: SLI: speciﬁc language impairment.\\nUnderstanding children’s memory and the way it\\ndevelops is of crucial importance for psychologists andother academic and professional groups. From a theor-etical perspective, the goal of providing a full account ofthe many processes and systems involved in humanmemory can only be achieved if the changes that takeplace in memory abilities during childhood, which cul-minate in adult memory function, are also known. Thereare more practical reasons too for needing to know aboutmemory in childhood. Eﬀective methods of educationdepend upon teachers understanding the capacities ofchildren of diﬀerent ages to learn and remember in-formation.Without studyingmemorydevelopment,thesecapacities cannot be known. Equally importantly, poormemory function can impair a child’s opportunities tolearn, and can lead to many diﬀerent proﬁles of learningdisability. The assessment of memory abilities thereforeprovides a crucial method of understanding the proﬁlesof learning diﬃculties, and of identifying eﬀectivemethods for their remediation, in individual children. Inaddition, understanding the reliability of children’s mem-ories is becoming an issue of increasing importance asmore children are providing testimony in the courtroom.These issues of current educational and psycholegalrelevance underscore the impact of understandingchildren’s memory in everyday life as well as in thelaboratory.\\nIt must be emphasised that the singularity of the term\\n‘‘memory’’ is misleading: there is no single memory storeor system that underpins all mnemonic experience.\\nRequests for reprints to: Susan E. Gathercole, Centre for the\\nStudy of Memory and Learning, Department of Psychology,University of Bristol, 8 Woodland Road, Bristol BS8 1TN,U.K. (E-mail: Sue.Gathercole !bristol.ac.uk).Rather, evidence from a range of sources—experimental\\nstudies of adults, neuropsychological patients, brainimaging techniques, as well as investigations of children’smemory—indicates that there are many separable mem-ory systems that can function relatively independently ofone another. The present review of memory in childhoodis organised around widely accepted distinctions betweenthe following memory systems: short-term memory andtwo long-term memory systems—autobiographical mem-ory and episodic memory. These aspects of memory wereselected for review as they reﬂect areas of signiﬁcantresearch activities in children’s memory in which im-portant advances in understanding have been achieved inrecent years.\\nShort-term Memory\\nThe term ‘‘short-term memory’’ is used to refer to\\nmemory for events that occurred in the very recent past,where the delay between presentation of the material tobe remembered and remembering is measured in terms ofseconds and possibly minutes rather than hours or days.Research on human short-term memory dating back tothe early 1960s has led to a bedrock of knowledge aboutthe underpinnings of short-term memory performance.One fact which became apparent relatively early on is thatshort-term memory performance is not supported by aunitary short-term memory system, but is instead servedby a suite of distinct short-term memory systems. Themost complete current speciﬁcation of short-term mem-ory is the working memory model of Baddeley and Hitch(1974), revised by Baddeley in 1986. Although originallydevised to account for adult short-term memory per-formance, this model has proved to be of great value\\n3\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='0d6a3c3a-0418-44c4-b3d0-8dce6d9198b7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='4 S.

For convenience, the working memorymodel is used here as a framework for presenting currentunderstanding of the nature of children’s memory de-velopment, although it should be noted that it is by nomeans the only account of short-term memory devel-opment (see, e.g., Cowan & Kail, 1996; Kail & Park,1994; Pascual-Leone & Baillargeon, 1994).\\nAccording to this model, working memory comprises\\nthreecomponents:the centralexecutive,the phonologicalloop, and the visuospatial sketchpad. The latter twocomponents, the phonological loop and the visuospatialsketchpad, were characterised by Baddeley and Hitch(1974), as ‘‘slave systems’’ that are specialised for theprocessing and manipulation of limited amounts ofinformation within highly speciﬁc domains. Material isstored in the phonological loop in terms of its sound-based phonological qualities, whereas the sketchpad hasthe capacity to maintain the spatial and visual propertiesof limited amounts of information. In contrast to thehighly speciﬁc informational domains in which these twoslave systems operate, the central executive is capable ofperforming a range of high-level functions. Functionsascribed to the central executive include the coordinationof the ﬂow of information through working memory, theretrieval of information from more permanent long-termmemory stores, the application of retrieval strategies,logical reasoning, and mental arithmetic (e.g. Baddeley,1986; Hitch, 1980).\\nThe theoretical speciﬁcation of each of these three\\ncomponents of working memory is by no means com-plete, and indeed is undergoing continuous revision in thelight both of new research and of the requirement forgreater theoretical speciﬁcation imposed by the devel-opment of computational models (Burgess & Hitch, 1992,1996). It is, however, notable that the basic tripartitedistinction between the central executive, phonologicalloop, and visuospatial sketchpad, based on experimentalstudies of normal adults, has received substantial in-dependent support in recent years from the developingneuroscience disciplines. Studies of both cognitive neuro-psychology and brain imaging have provided convergentevidence that both the brain areas and functional memorysystems mediating performance on phonological andvisuospatial short-term memory tasks are separate. In thecase of the phonological short-term memory system, theleft-hemisphere regions of Broca’s area and the prefrontalcortex are implicated, whereas visuospatial short-termmemory appears to be mediated by parietal and pre-frontal areas of the right hemisphere (Smith, Jonides, &Koeppe, 1996). Neuropsychological investigations haveyielded ﬁndings consistent with this view, that separatefunctional systems underpin phonological and visuo-spatial short-term memory. Neurological damage toparietal regions of the right hemisphere has been found toresult in marked deﬁcits in visual memory performancewhile verbal memory skills remain intact (Farah, 1988;Farah, Hamond, Levine, & Calvanio, 1988; Hanley,Young, & Pearson, 1991). Correspondingly, impairmentsin Broca’s area are associated with highly speciﬁc verbalshort-term memory deﬁcits but normal visuospatialmemory function (Basso, Spinnler, Vallar, & Zanobio,1982). These perspectives provide substantial conﬁr-mation that phonological and visuospatial short-term\\nmemory performance are mediated by functionally sep-arate memory systems, as the working memory modelproposes.\\nPhonological Short -term Memory\\nChildren’s level of performance on tests of phono-\\nlogical memory such as digit span and other serial recalltests increases dramatically over the early and middleyears of childhood. Memory span (a measure of themaximum number of unrelated verbal items that can beremembered in correct sequence) shows an average two-to three-fold increase from between two and three itemsat 4 years of age to about six items at 12 years. Figure 1illustrates this developmental function with data reportedby Hulme, Muir, Thompson, and Lawrence (1984) onmean numbers of items recalled by groups of childrenaged 4, 7, and 10 years and of an adult group on anauditory serial recall task.\\nThere have been many signiﬁcant advances in our\\nunderstanding of the changes in functioning of thephonological memory system that underpin this devel-opmental improvement in memory performance in recentyears. Before considering these ﬁndings and their impli-cations, it is ﬁrst necessary to provide a brief charac-terisation of the working memory component, believed,on the basis of studies of adult memory, to be the mostsigniﬁcant contributor to memory span and other serialorder tasks: the phonological loop (Baddeley, 1986). Thissystem consists of two subcomponents: a phonologicalstore, and a subvocal rehearsal process. Informationgains access to the phonological store either directly, viaauditory presentation of speech stimuli, or indirectly viainternally generated phonological codes for nonauditoryinputs such as printed words or familiar visual objects.Phonological representations of memory items decayrapidly in the phonological store, and typically becomeindiscriminable within about 2 seconds if unrehearsed(Baddeley, Thomson, & Buchanan, 1975). Subvocalrehearsal occurs serially and in real time, and acts torefresh decaying representations in the phonologicalstore. In this way, decay of representations within thephonological store can be oﬀset if the entire contents ofthe store can be rehearsed within 2 seconds. The rehearsalprocess also appears to be the mechanism by whichrepresentations in the phonological store are generatedfor stimuli such as printed words and pictures, which canbe recorded in phonological form but are nonauditory innature.\\nEvidence that the phonological store is indeed phono-\\nlogical in nature is provided by the phonological simi-larity eﬀects. Immediate serial recall is substantiallyimpaired if the memory items are similar to one anotherin their phonological structure (e.g. B,C,V,G,D), even\\nif the stimuli were presented visually at input (Conrad& Hull, 1964). This ﬁnding, replicated many times inthe intervening years, provides a clear indication thatmaterial is held in terms of its sound characteristicswithin the phonological loop.\\nThe two key experimental ﬁndings in support of the\\nview that the subvocal rehearsal process serves to main-tain information within the phonological store are the\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='56c4c00d-b05f-446b-9438-d12cf908ffb8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='5 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nFigure 1.

Based on data\\nfrom Hulme, Muir, Thomson, and Lawrence (1984).\\nword length and articulatory suppression phenomena.\\nThe word length eﬀect, initially established by Baddeleyet al. (1975), refers to the better serial recall of memorylists containing memory items with short names (e.g. one-syllable words such as cat,sun,bat) than those with long\\nnames (e.g. banana ,telephone ,piano). This phenomenon\\nhas been attributed to the subvocal rehearsal componentof the phonological loop. As rehearsal is believed to takelonger for items of long than short articulatory durationthere is a greater delay between successive rehearsals oflengthier items within the phonological store, providinggreater opportunity for loss of information due to decay.This account ﬁts well with ﬁndings that the word lengtheﬀect is eliminated when rehearsal is prevented byrequiring participants to engage in irrelevant articulationduring the memory task, a procedure known as ‘‘articu-latory suppression’’ (Baddeley, Lewis, & Vallar, 1984;Baddeley et al., 1975). It is argued that in this situation,the time-based rehearsal process cannot be engaged andso the beneﬁt of short over long memory items in the\\nphonological loop is lost.\\nThe development of the phonological loop . Investi-\\ngations of the sensitivity of children’s immediate memoryto these experimental variables have yielded evidence forhighly speciﬁc changes in phonological loop functionwith age. It appears that the phonological store com-ponent of the phonological loop is present even in veryyoung children, but that the subvocal rehearsal processdoes not emerge until about 7 years of age (Gathercole &Hitch, 1993). Provided that the memory items arepresented auditorily and so do not require subvocalrehearsal to gain access to the phonological loop,children’s immediate serial recall is sensitive to phono-logical similarity and word length at the youngest agegroups tested—between 3 and 5 years of age (Ford &Silber, 1994; Gathercole & Adams, 1994; Hitch &Halliday, 1983; Hulme et al., 1984). With pictorialpresentation of memory items, however, children of this\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='b8deb9fa-8afe-494f-a33b-d8477b23a4ef', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='6 S. E. GATHERCOLE\\nage are not impaired when memory items have labels that\\nare either lengthy in articulatory duration or are phono-logically similar to one another, relative to children aged7 years and older (Hitch, Halliday, Dodd, & Littler,1989). Rather than recoding the pictures into the phono-logical form required for entry into the phonologicalstore, younger children appear to attempt to remembersuch memory stimuli in terms of their visual character-istics (Hitch, Halliday, Schaafstal, & Schraagen, 1988;Longoni & Scalisi, 1994).\\nOther ﬁndings too ﬁt well with this view that young\\nchildren fail to exploit a rehearsal strategy for non-auditory memory stimuli. One of the earliest methods ofidentifying rehearsal was to observe whether childrenperforming immediate memory tasks produced any overtsigns of rehearsal such as lip movements and whisperingin the interval between memory presentations. Using thistechnique, Flavell, Beach, and Chinsky (1966) failed toﬁnd any evidence for rehearsal in children below 7 yearsof age.\\nA diﬀerent approach to the issue of when rehearsal\\nemerges was taken by Johnston, Johnson, and Gray(1987) in a study of 5-year-old children. When theirimmediate serial recall was initially tested with sequencesof nameable pictures, the children showed no sensitivityto whether the pictures names were long or short inarticulatory duration. Johnson et al. then gave thechildren training in the use of overt and covert cumulativerehearsal strategies in serial recall. When tested followingthis training, the children did show superior recall ofpictures with short over those with long names. Thisstudy provides direct evidence, ﬁrst that subvocal re-hearsal is not used spontaneously at this age, and secondthat this strategy can be induced with training. It also ﬁtswell with the notion that the word length eﬀect arisesfrom the rehearsal process, which is, as we shall seeshortly, a matter of some contention.\\nA third line of support for the view that rehearsal is not\\nused in early childhood arises from studies in whichmeasures of both auditory memory span and of the rateat which the children can articulate the memory itemswere taken. According to the view advanced earlier,access to the phonological store for auditorily presentedmaterial takes place without rehearsal, although repre-sentations in the phonological store do not receive thebeneﬁt of constant refreshment provided by rehearsal inyounger age groups. Consistent with this view, articu-lation rate and memory span are not positively correlatedwith one another for children below 7 years of age(Cowan et al., 1994; Gathercole & Adams, 1993;Gathercole, Adams, & Hitch, 1994; Henry, 1994). Foradults, in contrast, strongly positive associations arefound (Gathercole et al., 1994). The implication of thisdevelopmental change is that young children, unlikeadults, do not depend on a time-based (rehearsal) strategyto maintain the contents of their phonological stores; thespeed at which they articulate, therefore, does not matter.\\nAlthough there is now ample evidence in support of the\\nview that rehearsal does not spontaneously emerge beforethe middle childhood years, some puzzles remain. Onearea of uncertainty concerns the source of word lengtheﬀects in serial recall. With auditory presentation, evenvery young children show poorer recall of lists of longthan short words (Gathercole & Adams, 1994; Hitch &\\nHalliday, 1983; Hulme et al., 1984). This should not be soif the children cannot rehearse. The most likely ex-planation is that word length eﬀects in short-termmemory do not arise solely from rehearsal. There isaccumulating evidence that the greater delay in outputinvolved in the spoken recall of lengthy over shortmemory items may itself be suﬃcient to cause extra decayinthe phonological store andhence impairrecall accuracy(Avons, Wight, & Pammer, 1994; Brown & Hulme, 1995;Cowan et al., 1992). Consistent with this view, childrenbelow 7 years of age show no word length eﬀect even forauditory material if memory performance is not sampledby a serial spoken recall procedure and hence is notsubject to diﬀerential output delays for short and longitems (Henry, 1991).\\nThe principal developmental change in phonological\\nshort-term memory identiﬁed so far is that prior to about7 years of age, serial recall performance is mediated by thephonological store component of the phonological loop.During the preschool and early school years, however, itdoes not appear likely that children use a subvocalrehearsal strategy to maintain the decaying phonologicalrepresentations in the store. Rather, they choose toremember pictures by recalling visual features. Beyond 7years, an adult-like cumulative rehearsal strategy emergesand is employed to maximise retention in the phono-logical store. From this point onwards, nonauditorymemory material is recoded into a phonological codesuitable for the phonological loop when possible. Thecontinuing increases in articulation rate up to the latechildhood years enhance the eﬀectiveness of the subvocalrehearsal process and hence give rise to further improve-ments in memory span beyond the onset of rehearsal.\\nThis model of developmental change provides a good\\naccount of a wide range of experimental data, althoughthe account is by no means complete. One outstandingissue concerns the fact that memory span increasesdevelopmentally even prior to the period at whichchildren learn to use rehearsal (e.g. Gathercole & Adams,1994). Why is this? One possibility is that span increasesduring the period up to 7 years of age because olderchildren are able to articulate items more rapidly at recall,and hence are able to reduce the decay of memory itemsin the phonological store prior to output. The necessaryﬁne-grained analyses of developmental change in im-mediate memory span in the pre-rehearsal period, whichwould allow a direct test of this hypothesis, have not,however, yet been conducted.\\nNote that the account presented above explains de-\\nvelopmental increases in memory span in terms ofincreased rates of articulation, both during the pre-rehearsal period (when its locus is in spoken output) andthe post-rehearsal period (when its sources are probablyin both covert rehearsal and spoken output). If thisaccount is true, diﬀerences in memory span between agegroups should be eliminated if their articulation rates areheld constant. Two studies have tested this hypothesis,and found that changes in articulation rates provide asigniﬁcant but only partial account of the increase inmemory span during childhood (Henry & Millar, 1991;Roodenrys, Hulme, & Brown, 1993). Even after dif-ferences in rates of articulation between younger and\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e6f7fd69-992d-448e-8859-599b3be43985', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='7 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nolder children have been controlled, residual diﬀerences\\nin memory span were identiﬁed in both studies. De-velopmental changes in phonological loop function there-fore do not provide a full explanation of why memoryspan increases with age. So what else changes?\\nLong-term knowledge and immediate memory in chil -\\ndren. To explain why the phonological loop might not\\nprovide a complete account of age-related increases inimmediate memory in childhood, it is necessary to returnto the working memory model. Although the phono-logical loop is the component that is specialised for theretention and manipulation of information in a phono-logical form, and may be the single most importantcontributor to immediate memory, other memorysystems and processes have also long been known to playa role (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). One particularlysigniﬁcant source of additional support for immediaterecall of verbal material comes from long-term storage oflexical knowledge, or the mental lexicon. Its contributionto immediate serial recall is simply demonstrated by thesubstantial recall advantage to memory sequences con-taining familiar words, such as gorilla ,radio, andbotany ,\\nover lists containing nonwords, such as taﬀost ,crepog ,\\nandteggid (Hulme, Maughan, & Brown, 1991). As the\\nword and nonword memory stimuli do not diﬀer inarticulatory duration or amount of phonological in-formation, the lexicality eﬀect (i.e. the recall advantage toword over nonword lists) must arise from the additionalavailability of long-term knowledge about the familiarwords. A series of studies by Hulme and colleaguessuggests that the lexicality eﬀect is mediated by the useof long-term phonological knowledge about the soundsof words rather than stored nonphonological attributessuch as word meaning (Brown & Hulme, 1992; Hulmeet al., 1991). These researchers suggest that stored phono-logical knowledge about the structures of words is usedto ‘‘ﬁll in’’ incomplete information in representations ofwords in the phonological store, in a process describedas redintegration (see, too, Schweikert, 1993). With non-word stimuli, of course, there is no such existing long-term speciﬁcation with which to recover missing in-formation in the phonological trace.\\nTheundoubtedcontributionoflong-termlexicalknow-\\nledge to immediate memory raises an interesting possi-bility. Could one source of the developmental improve-ment in verbal memory span, that is not due to increasedarticulation rate, be the magnitude of the lexical con-tribution? Findings of Roodenrys et al. (1993) suggestthat this might be the case. Comparing memory span in 6-\\nand 10-year-old children, they found a relatively greater\\nadvantage of memory for words over nonwords in theolder group that could not be accounted for in terms ofdiﬀerences in articulatory speed between the groups orthe stimuli. Although narrowly missing statistical signiﬁ-cance, this ﬁnding provides preliminary support for theview that older children develop more extensive andstable long-term knowledge about words, and that thiscan be used to increasing beneﬁt to supplement phono-logical loop representations of lexical items.\\nThere is also evidence that a more basic kind of long-\\nterm knowledge about the structure of the nativelanguage mediates immediate memory performance, evenwhen nonwords are the memory stimuli: this is knowl-edge about the probabilistic structure of sound com-\\nbinations in the language. Across several studies(Gathercole, 1995; Gathercole & Martin, 1996;Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1991), we havefound that children are better at repeating multisyllabicnonword stimuli when the wordlikeness of the nonwords,as judged by adults, is high (e.g. ‘‘commerine’’) than low(e.g. ‘‘loddernaypish’’). Similarly, children recall non-word sequences more accurately if the nonwords containadjacent phoneme pairs that are high in probabilityof occurrence within English (Gathercole, Frankish,Pickering, & Peaker, 1997). Thus even for unfamiliaritems, an individual’s existing knowledge about thestructure of the language can be used to enhance recallaccuracy.\\nPerhaps, then, one further component of the increase\\nin verbal memory span with age is that the child’sexpanding vocabulary allows for better knowledge aboutthe phonotactic properties of the language, and hence canbe used more eﬀectively to enhance phonological looprepresentations of the sound structure of memory stimuli.Consistent with this view, Gathercole (1995) found that5-year-old children showed a greater advantage inrepetition accuracy for nonwords of high compared tolow wordlikeness than did 4-year-old children. Theseﬁndings are encouraging, and a key priority for futureresearch is to provide a much more complete devel-opmental analysis of the use of both lexical and phono-tactic knowledge in children’s immediate verbal memory.\\nDevelopmental impairments of phonological short -term\\nmemory . One notable feature of children’s performance\\non tests of phonological short-term memory is the highdegree of variability across individuals. Although mem-ory span increases regularly across age when assessed onthe basis of group data at each chronological point, verylarge diﬀerences are found in span estimates for in-dividual children at any one age. For unselected cohortsof young children, these diﬀerences in phonologicalmemory capacity have been found to relate closely to twoimportant aspects of language development: vocabularyacquisition (e.g. Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989, 1993;Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1992; Michas& Henry, 1994), and speech production (Adams &Gathercole, 1995, 1996; Blake, Austin, Cannon, Lisus,& Vaughan, 1994; Speidel, 1989, 1991).\\nThese and related ﬁndings have led to the proposal that\\na primary function of the phonological loop is to supportlanguage learning (Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, inpress; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). Consistent withthis view, children with speciﬁc language impairment have\\nbeen found to have extremely poor phonological short-term memory function. The evidence for phonologicalmemory deﬁcits in children with this disorder, and for thepossible role of these deﬁcits in the symptomatology ofthe disorder, is brieﬂy considered below.\\nIt is estimated that despite having normal levels of\\ngeneral intellectual attainment and in the absence ofany other problems of a physical, social, or emotionalnature, 5% of children fail to develop language normally(Stevenson & Richman, 1976). This condition is widelyknown as speciﬁc language impairment (SLI), and isassociated with persisting deﬁcits in the production andcomprehension of language, including in particular poor\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e33807bc-0a9a-4c41-8271-92c39e070a47', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='8 S.

For many children diagnosedas speciﬁc language impaired, a genetic origin seemslikely (Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996; Gopnik & Crago,1991).\\nA variety of accounts of the central deﬁcit under-\\npinning SLI have been advanced over many years (seeBishop, 1992, for review). Current inﬂuential theories ofSLI include those identifying impairments in generalprocessing resource (Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996;Masterson & Kamhi, 1992), rapid perceptual processing(Merzenich et al., 1996; Stark & Heinz, 1996; Tallalet al., 1996), and grammatical morphology (Leonard,McGregor, & Allen, 1992; Gopnik & Crago, 1991). It isnoteworthy that research on these aspects of putative SLIdeﬁcits typically depends upon a methodology in whichSLI children are compared with their age-matchedcontrols. This is problematic, as it is unclear whether it isappropriate to characterise the SLI children as eitherdisordered in this particular aspect of cognitive orperceptual processing, or performing at a languageability-appropriate level. Consistent with the latter ‘‘de-velopment lag’’ interpretation, when comparisons aremade between SLI groups and language-matched con-trols the common pattern often yields no diﬀerencesbetween groups (e.g. Visto, Cranford, & Scudder, 1996).\\nOn the other hand, the SLI children have consistently\\nbeen found to underperform even younger language-matched controls on tests of phonological short-termmemory. Their deﬁcit is particularly marked when pro-cedures such as nonword repetition that use phono-logically unfamiliar stimuli are employed (Gathercole &Baddeley, 1990; Gillam, Cowan, & Day, 1995; Gillam &van Kleeck, 1996; James, van Steenbrugge, & Chiveralls,1994; Kail, Hale, Leonard, & Nippold, 1984;Montgomery, 1995). For example, the SLI group studiedby Gathercole and Baddeley (1990) had a mean chrono-logical age of 8, performed at the level of an average 6-year-old on standardised language tests of vocabularyknowledge, language comprehension, and reading, buthad nonword repetition accuracy scores of the typical 4-year-old child. The problems in nonword repetition ofthis SLI group, as in the groups in the other studies citedabove, therefore far outweigh even their poor perform-ance on language measures that are the criterion variablesfor speciﬁc language impairment (e.g. Stark & Tallal,1981). Furthermore, a recent study of SLI and controltwins by Bishop et al. (1996) has yielded high heritabilityestimates for nonword repetition, which, the authorssuggest, may provide an excellent phenotypic marker forthe SLI condition.\\nAlthough the data on phonological memory in SLI\\nchildren are largely consistent across studies, theoreticalinterpretation of the source of the SLI deﬁcits on tests ofnonword repetition and serial recall remains at present amatter of debate. The view that we have advanced is thatthese deﬁcits arise from extreme limitations in phono-logical loop capacity, probably located in the phono-logical store rather than in the subvocal rehearsal process,which appears to operate at a language-appropriate levelin SLI children (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990, 1993). It isthis poor temporary storage of incoming speech stimuli,we propose, that may lie at the root of the diﬃcultiesencountered by SLI children in establishing durable long-\\nterm phonological representations of novel words (e.g.Dollaghan, 1987; Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996; Rice,Buhr, & Nemeth, 1991). The phonological storage deﬁcitmay also contribute to the impaired abilities of SLIchildren to learn complex syntactic patterns, in themanner suggested by Adams and Gathercole (1995, 1996)and Speidel (1991). Thus, the suggestion is that impair-ments in a child’s ability to store phonological materialtemporarily may be suﬃcient to disrupt many diﬀerentaspects of language development to a suﬃcient degree toyield a proﬁle of speciﬁc language impairment.\\nThis phonological storage hypothesis is not uncon-\\ntentious. One problem for the account is that there aresome indications that SLI children are impaired inperceptual processing of nonword stimuli as well as intheir repetition, raising the possibility that their poorperformance on the memory tasks is secondary to poorperceptual skills (James et al., 1994; Montgomery, 1995).The detailed deﬁcits of the SLI children on perceptualdiscrimination tasks are, however, inconsistent acrossthese two studies. It is particularly notable thatMontgomery only found reliable deﬁcits in perceptualdiscrimination in his SLI group when pairs of lengthy(four-syllable) nonwords were presented for discrimi-nation. But as the eight-syllable memory load involved inmaintaining the two stimuli in order to make thecomparison is likely to considerably exceed the storagecapacity of the SLI children, this ﬁnding need notnecessarily indicate a perceptual deﬁcit at all. Furtherinvestigation of this issue is required, using procedures inwhich perceptual and short-term storage contributions toperformance are varied more systematically.\\nAnalysis of the long-term memory involvement in\\nimmediate phonological memory performance in SLIchildren is also needed in the light of recent advances inunderstanding the signiﬁcance of both lexical and phono-tactic knowledge to tasks such as nonword repetition andmemory span (Gathercole, 1995; Gathercole et al., 1997;Hulme et al., 1991; Roodenrys et al., 1993). It is possiblethat at least some of the deﬁciency in the performance ofSLI children on these tasks may arise from impoverisheduse of either of both lexical and phonotactic knowledge tosupplement phonological loop storage of memory items.By applying the techniques developed recently in studiesof unselected samples of children to SLI groups, thesehypotheses can now be readily put to the empirical test.\\nSummary . Phonological short-term memory abilities\\ndevelop rapidly through the early and middle childhoodyears. Much of this development appears to arise fromdevelopmental increases in the speed of rehearsing and ofretrieving material from memory, and from the emerg-ence of subvocal rehearsal as a strategy for introducingnonauditory material into the phonological loop and foractively maintaining the contents of the phonologicalstore. Children’s phonological memory capacity hasimportant consequences for their abilities to learn newwords, and the very poor phonological memory skillstypically found in children with speciﬁc language im-pairment may lie at the root of their failure to developlanguage normally.\\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that immediate\\nmemory performance also reﬂects the contribution to\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='57e34b80-9dc2-4b91-a1b7-c5e7087b617f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='9 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nlong-term knowledge, both of familiar words and of the\\nprobabilistic structure of sound patterns within the nativelanguage. New techniques for assessing the extent ofthese long-term memory contributions should allowsystematic evaluation of whether these are the source ofage diﬀerences in phonological memory that do notreﬂect changes in the operation of the phonological loop.\\nVisuospatial Short -term Memory\\nBaddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed that our ca-\\npacities to remember and manipulate mentally the physi-cal features and dimensions of events such as shape,colour, and movement are served by a diﬀerent limited-capacitycomponentofworkingmemory:the visuospatialsketchpad. Subsequent experimental studies have lentstrong support to this dissociation between the memorysystems contributing to short-term memory for verbaland visuospatial material (e.g. Logie, Zucco, & Baddeley,1990; Smyth & Scholey, 1996).\\nLogie (1994) has recently proposed that the sketchpad,\\nlike the phonological loop, has two primary subcom-ponents: a visual store in which the physical character-istics of objects and events can be represented, and aspatial mechanism that can be used for planning move-ments and that may also serve a rehearsal function byreactivating the contents of the visual store. Although inpractice very little memory material can purely becharacterised in terms of either visual or spatial features,this distinction between the capacities for visual andspatial processing is certainly consistent with neuro-psychological evidence of preserved visual but not spatialmemory (Farah et al., 1988) and vice versa (Hanley et al.,1991). It also ﬁts well with selective interference ofmemory for spatial information by concurrent spatialactivity (Baddeley & Lieberman, 1980), and of irrelevantvisual material on memory for visual items (Logie, 1986;Quinn & McConnell, 1996).\\nThe development of the visuospatial sketchpad . Al-\\nthough the ways in which the operation of the visuo-spatial sketchpad changes with age during childhoodhave not been as extensively researched as those of thephonological loop, there is now a basic understanding ofsome signiﬁcant changes in its functioning. One im-portant change is that younger children are more de-pendent than older children or adults on using thesketchpad to support immediate memory for visualmaterial. Hitch et al. (1988) demonstrated that in a task inwhich a series of pictures of nameable objects arepresented for recall, 5-year-old children are impaired inrecalling memory lists in which the objects share manyphysical features (e.g. pen,fork,comb,key) over those\\nwith few shared features (e.g. doll,bath,glove,spoon). A\\ngroup of 10-year-old children, in contrast, showed nosensitivity in recall to the visual similarity of the pictures,but were impaired when the pictures had lengthy names(e.g.umbrella ,kangaroo ,policeman ,banana ). These and\\nother ﬁndings reported by Hitch et al. and Hitch,Woodin, and Baker (1989) indicate that older childrenadopt a strategy of verbally recoding pictures wherepossible and so use the phonological loop to mediateperformance on the ‘‘visual’’ memory task. As youngchildren are not able to generate phonological codes forvisual items covertly, they are forced to rely instead on\\ntheir recall of the purely visuospatial characteristics ofthe memory stimuli.\\nIn order to provide a pure assessment of the de-\\nvelopment of visuospatial memory capacities, it is there-fore important to use memory tasks in which the stimulido not correspond to familiar items that can reliably berecoded into phonological form. One such paradigm thathas been employed as a means of assessing primarily thevisual component of the sketchpad is the pattern spantask (Wilson, Scott, & Power, 1987). In this task, a two-dimensional pattern composed of squares that are eitherﬁlled or unﬁlled is brieﬂy displayed on each trial. Thechild is then showed the same pattern with a single ﬁlledblock missing, and is required to point to its originallocation. The number of blocks in the test patterns arethen increased until memory accuracy falls below acriterionlevel,yieldingfor each individualaspan measureof number of blocks reliably remembered.\\nUsing this technique, Wilson et al. (1987) showed that\\nvisual memory span increases substantially and regularlybetween 5 and 11 years, by which time adult levels ofperformance are achieved, as illustrated in Fig. 2.Whereas at 5 years of age mean pattern span was about 4blocks, span estimates for 11-year-olds and adults hadmuch higher values of around 14 blocks. Similar patternsof development of visual pattern span were also obtainedby Miles, Morgan, Milne, and Morris (1996). In theirstudy, the method of memory test was varied from thepartial recall procedure used by Wilson et al. to rec-ognition (in which condition the participants had to judgewhich of a pair of patterns had been studied previously)and free recall (in which a blank matrix was presented,and the task was to point to the squares that were ﬁlled inthe test stimulus). In each case, relatively steep devel-opmental increases were obtained across groups ofchildren aged 5, 7, and 10 years, and adults, with spanestimates lower across all ages in the more time-con-suming free recall condition. We have recently replicatedthe developmental function for the free recall version ofthe pattern span task (Pickering, Gathercole, & Hall,1997).\\nIt may, however, be misleading to interpret this\\ndevelopmental proﬁle solely in terms of age-relatedchanges in the capacity of the sketchpad to retain visualinformation. Despite the apparently nonverbal nature ofthe pattern span test stimuli, both the Wilson et al. (1987)and Miles et al. (1996) studies provide strong evidencethat a substantial component of the developmentalincrease in pattern span arises from the contribution ofmemory components other than the visuospatial sketch-pad. Wilson et al. (1987) tested pattern span under avariety of concurrent task conditions, and found thatinterpolating a 10-second interval of spoken arithmetic-related activity (counting backwards aloud for oldergroups, forward counting for the youngest age group)between presentation of the pattern and recalling itreduced pattern span considerably, and that the mag-nitude of this disruption increased progressively between5 and 11 years. Engaging in irrelevant mental arithmeticis widely believed to require the involvement of thecentralexecutive (Baddeley &Hitch, 1974), and irrelevantarticulation appears to block subvocal rehearsal\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='8b596f54-bd0e-41e5-9efb-2ee273edf715', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '8', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='10 S.

Thus, the disruptive eﬀect of\\nspoken mental arithmetic on pattern span for olderchildren and adults indicates signiﬁcant involvement ofeither or both of these two nonvisual components ofworking memory in the pattern span task. At least someof the increase in children’s capacities to retain visualpatterns therefore appears to reﬂect increasing use ofnonvisual strategies to mediate memory performance,rather than enhanced visual memory per se.\\nDue to the nature of the interpolated task used by\\nWilson et al. (1987), their data do not identify whetherolder children are using the phonological loop to sup-plement the visuospatial sketchpad in the pattern span(by verbally recoding the stimuli) or the central executive.Other ﬁndings indicate that both of these components ofworking memory may play a role. Earlier work withadults had already established that recall of similarmatrix-style visual patterns is greatly disrupted by sub-sequent silent mental arithmetic (Phillips & Christie,1977), implicating central executive involvement inmemory for patterns. And Miles et al. (1996) found thatconcurrent articulatory suppression, which blocks the useof the phonological loop, signiﬁcantly impaired patternspans for the 10-year-old and adult groups, particularlyon the recognition and partial recall versions of the task.\\nThe disruption in visual pattern span caused by prevent-ing rehearsal in the Miles et al. study was considerablyless substantial than that observed by Wilson et al. with aconcurrent task loading on both the central executive andthe phonological loop. It therefore seems plausible thatolder participants in these studies were able to engage ina range of nonvisual strategies to supplement the contri-bution of the sketchpad, which called upon (possiblyacross diﬀerent trials and diﬀerent individuals) both ofthese nonvisual components of working memory.\\nSo, children’s capacities to retain visual patterns over\\nshort intervals increase greatly between 5 and 11 years ofage, by which time adult levels of performance are moreor less achieved. The developmental increase appears tobe due in part to a genuine increase in the capacity of thesketchpad to hold material in visual form, but also toincreasing use of nonvisual strategies using both thephonological loop and the central executive to sup-plement memory performance.\\nOne important issue that has not been directly ad-\\ndressed as yet is whether the increased visuospatialsketchpad contribution over this developmental periodsimply reﬂects an undiﬀerentiated increase in the capacity\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='01ae0a4b-7988-4f59-886f-6ade6993c5bd', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '9', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='11 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nDigit span\\nCorsi span\\nFigure 3.

Evidence reviewed aboveindicates that a signiﬁcant component of the develop-mental increase in the neighbouring phonological loopsystem does reﬂect the emergence of an active rehearsalstrategy, which acts to maintain representations in themore passive store component; this could also be true ofthe visuospatial sketchpad. There are now concurrenttask techniques available that are known to disrupt thetwo components selectively; the visual store appears to beimpaired by irrelevant visual information (Logie, 1986;Quinn & McConnell, 1996) whereas tapping impairsspatial memory (Smyth & Pendleton, 1989). By applyingthese techniques, it should be possible in future researchto analyse the contributions of the visual and spatialcomponents of the sketchpad to the developmentalchanges in visual memory already established.\\nSome basic information is, however, known about\\nchanges in abilities to retain spatial information with age.The method that has been used to test spatial memory inchildren is the Corsi blocks task. In this task, a three-dimensional display of nine blocks is placed in front ofthe participant, who observes the experimenter tappingthe blocks in an unsystematic sequence. The task is torepeat the activity, tapping the same blocks in the samesequence. As in the digit span task, the number of\\nmemory items (blocks in the case of the Corsi task,numbers in digit span) increases regularly up to the pointat which the participant can no longer reliably reproducethe correct sequence, and a span estimate is obtained.\\nThe developmental course of children’s memory spans\\non both the digit span and Corsi blocks tasks wasinvestigated by Isaacs and Vargha-Khadem (1989), in astudy of children aged between 7 and 15 years. As shownin Fig. 3, both span tasks showed a regular increaseacross this age range corresponding to about 1 ±5 items of\\nspan, with Corsi spans at each age lagging about one itemof span behind digit span. One interesting feature of thisstudy was that for both the verbal and spatial span tasks,children were tested on their forward and backward recallof the test sequences. Digit span is greatly impaired by therequirement to recall in backwards order, in line withnormative data on forward and backward digit spanprovided by standardised ability tests such as the WISC-R (Wechsler, 1982). What was not known prior to theIsaacs and Vargha-Khadem study was that in contrast,Corsi span is equivalent whether recall is tested in aforwards or backwards order. This indicates that orderinformation is extracted in a fundamentally diﬀerentmanner from spatial memory than from the phonologicalloop. It should, however, be noted that subsequentﬁndings from adult data suggest that the diﬀerential\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='121c0864-520a-432c-b71e-7b88deca6c4e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='12 S.

GATHERCOLE\\nimpairment with backward recall may be due in part at\\nleast to the diﬀerential availability of item information inthe conventional Corsi blocks and digit span procedures(Farrand & Jones, 1996).\\nWe have recently investigated the relationships be-\\ntween children’s capacities to retain phonological, visual,and spatial information in short-term memory (Pickeringet al., 1997). In an initial study, 5- and 8-year-old childrenwere tested on conventional measures of pattern span,Corsi block recall, and digit span. Scores on each taskwere uncorrelated with one another, suggesting thatphonological, visual, and spatial memory capacities maybe dissociable even in young children (see also, Pickering,Gathercole, & Peaker, in press).\\nIn a subsequent study, we constructed versions of the\\npattern span and Corsi blocks tasks that were directlycomparable except in temporal order. Our pattern spanstimuli were arrays of squares containing equal numbersof ﬁlled and unﬁlled blocks, similar to those employed byWilson et al. (1987). The task of the child was to studyeach pattern for 2 seconds on a computer screen, and thento indicate on an empty square the locations of the ﬁlledblocks in the test item. This method of test corresponds tothe free recall technique used by Miles et al. (1996). Spanwas estimated in the usual way by increasing the numberof squares in the test items until the children were unableto perform accurately.\\nIn the corresponding spatial task, the child viewed on\\nthe screen an initially empty square, in which blocksbecame ﬁlled one at a time. The child’s task at the end ofthe sequence was to point to the squares that had beenﬁlled at presentation in the same order as they hadoccurred on the screen. This provides a two-dimensionalanalogue of the conventional three-dimensional versionof the Corsi blocks task. Across our pattern and spatialtasks, the item content (i.e. the location of the ﬁlledblocks in the squares) was equivalent, as was the methodof recall. The tasks only diﬀered in the presence of orderinformation and the requirement to recall it in the spatialversion. Children aged 5, 7 and 10 years participated inthese tasks.\\nTwo noteworthy ﬁndings emerged from the study.\\nFirst, scores on the pattern span and spatial span wereuncorrelated with one another, despite the close cor-respondence between the information content and para-digms employed in the two cases. This reinforces theconclusion that diﬀerent memory capacities may under-pin memory for visual material with and without atemporal dimension, and is broadly consistent with thedistinction between a visual store and a spatial move-ment-based system in the sketchpad (Logie, 1994).\\nSecond, there was an age-related increase in span in\\nboth tasks. This function was, however, much steeper forthe pattern span than spatial span task: whereas the twospan estimates were similar in the youngest age groups,the beneﬁts to pattern span over spatial span were verysubstantial indeed by 10 years of age. At a general level,the diﬀerent gradients of the spatial and pattern spanfunctions lend further weight to the view that they areserved by diﬀerent memory systems. More speciﬁcally,the steeper increase in pattern span with age may reﬂecttheincreasingusebyolderchildrenofnonvisualstrategiesto supplement their memory for the visual patterns (inline with ﬁndings of Wilson et al., 1987; and Miles et al.,\\n1996) but not for the temporal order of the elements in thespatial task. This interpretation requires conﬁrmationusing dual task techniques; if correct, it indicates thatmemory for spatial information distributed across time isextremely restricted, and does not enjoy the opportunityfor other sources of memory support that are availablefor purely visual conﬁgurations.\\nIn summary, the capacity to retain information about\\nthe visuospatial characteristics of events for short periodsof time is mediated by a short-term memory systemdissociated from the phonological loop, and may consistof dissociable visual and spatial }temporal subcom-\\nponents. Although young children can retain both kindsof information in memory, their abilities to do so undergosubstantial increases between 5 and 11 years of age, whenshort-term memory capacity approaches adult levels.\\nImpairmentsofthevisuospatialsketchpad . Thesketch-\\npad, as tapped primarily by tasks requiring the retentionof meaningless verbal material such as grids containingcells ﬁlled at random, shows a regular developmentalincrease in capacity during the early school years. What,though, is the sketchpad used for in real life? Why is itthere? One potential answer is that the sketchpadprovides the facility to engage in mental imagery; theextent to which everyday cognitive activities call uponthis facility is, however, unclear.\\nAnother possibility is that the temporary storage\\ncapacity of the visuospatial sketchpad mediates the long-term learning of the visual and spatial coordinates ofnovel objects, in much the same way as the phonologicalloop appears to be crucial in supporting the learning ofthe sounds of new words. This idea is supported by astudy by Hanley et al. (1991) of a neuropsychologicalpatient, ELD, who had very poor short-term visuospatialmemory (including lower Corsi block span) followingdamage to the right hemisphere. Most interestingly, aftersustaining the brain damage ELD was unable to learnnew routes such as the way back to her new ﬂat or to learnto recognise the faces of previously unfamiliar people.\\nPerhaps, then, the sketchpad is used in childhood, as in\\nlater life, to support the learning of new visual and spatialinformation. If this is the case, we might expect thatconcurrent activities known to disturb selectively theoperation of the visuospatial sketchpad should alsoimpair the long-term learning of faces and routes. Therehas, however, been no systematic evaluation to date ofthe consequences for either face or route learning ofblocking components of working memory.\\nIf the sketchpad is crucial for learning as well as short-\\nterm retention, it should also follow that the substantialindividual diﬀerences in children’s abilities to retain suchmaterial over short periods of time (Cornoldi, Vecchia, &Tressoldi, 1995) should be closely related to their skills atrecognising new faces and learning spatial routes. Morespeciﬁcally, children with severely compromised abilitiesto maintain visuospatial information temporarily shouldalso be impaired on these real-life visuospatial learningtasks. One group who provide the opportunity to test thelatter hypothesis are children with Williams syndrome, arare genetic disorder leading to learning disabilities thatare considerably more substantial in the aspects ofvisuospatial cognition than language, including short-\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='e84f56a8-fe1e-4b7e-8756-a00c37c3cd7f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '11', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='13 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nterm memory (e.g. Bellugi, Marks, Bihrle, & Sabo, 1988;\\nJarrold, Baddeley, & Hewes, in press; Vicari, Brizzolara,Carlesimo, Pezzini, & Volterra, 1996; Wang & Bellugi,1994). Do these children encounter undue diﬃculty inlearning novel information such as unfamiliar faces andnew spatial routes? In terms of faces, the answer isprobably ‘‘no’’, as face processing in individuals withWilliams syndrome is considered to be relatively sparedin comparison with other aspects of visuospatial cog-nition (e.g. Karmiloﬀ-Smith, Klima, Bellugi, Grant, &Baron-Cohen, 1995). However, their abilities to learnnew spatial patterns are certainly impaired, but it is tooearly to conclude whether this long-term learning deﬁcitis speciﬁc to the visuospatial domain (Vicari et al., 1996).Thus, the ﬁndings to date are encouraging but incom-plete.\\nThe Central Executive\\nMany diﬀerent functions have been attributed to the\\nﬂexible but limited resource of the central executivecomponent of working memory. One general class offunctions relate to its putative regulatory and controlactivities: the central executive has been suggested to beresponsible for controlling the ﬂow of informationthrough working memory, for the retrieval of materialfrom more permanent long-term memory systems, andalso possibly for the control of action, planning, andgoal-directed behaviour (Baddeley, 1986). A second classof function is provided by speciﬁc strategies and special-ised types of computation ascribed to the executive: theseinclude retrieval strategies (Baddeley & Hitch, 1977,1993), logical reasoning (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974), andmental arithmetic (Hitch, 1980). Finally, some views ofthe central executive attribute to it both storage andprocessing functions that are fuelled by a limited resource(e.g. Case, Kurland, & Goldberg, 1982; Daneman &Carpenter, 1980, 1983; Just & Carpenter, 1992).\\nDevelopmental changes and disorders in the higher-\\nlevel functions of the central executive, related to plan-ning and goal-directed behaviour, have recently beenreviewed by Pennington and Ozonoﬀ (1996). The presentreview, in contrast, focuses on providing a developmentalanalysis of the ‘‘storage and processing’’ functions of thecentral executive. One inﬂuential research group hasprovided a systematic analysis of central executive func-tion using tasks that impose combined storage andprocessing loads on the individual, both independently ofthe working memory model of Baddeley and Hitch(1974). Daneman and Carpenter (1980) used the term‘‘working memory’’ to refer to a capacity-limited systemin which the resource burdens imposed by processinginformation and storing it are shared; this limitedresource is now termed ‘‘activation’’ (Just & Carpenter,1992). The crucial point is that if the amount of activationthat an individual has available is exceeded by thedemands of a task, there will be a trade-oﬀ betweenstorage and processing; as storage needs increase, therewill be less activation available to support processing,and vice versa. Many studies of adults have shown thatthere are substantial individual diﬀerences in activationlevels, as indexed by complex working memory tasks thatimpose combined processing and storage demands (see\\nDaneman & Merikle, 1996, for recent review and meta-analysis). Typical examples of complex working memorytasks are reading and listening span, in which anindividual has to process incoming information (eitherreading or listening to sentences, according to the versionof the task) at the same time as retaining the sequence ofthe ﬁnal words of the preceding sentences (Daneman &Carpenter, 1980). Another complex working memorytask is backward digit span, in which the task is to recalla digit sequence in backward order. Each of these tasksclearly require both storage and transformation ofmaterial. Importantly, individual diﬀerences in workingmemory (i.e. central executive) capacity indexed by suchtasks appear to be directly related to abilities to com-prehend and manipulate language. Thus, it appears thatworking memory capacity may have a direct impact onan individual’s everyday life.\\nPerformance on complex working memory span tasks\\nimproves during childhood. Data from Siegel (1994),summarised in Fig. 4, show a regular increase in listeningspan between 6 and 15 years of age.\\nOne account of the changes in cognitive functioning\\nunderpinning the improvements in working memory spanover the childhood years is provided by a neo-Piagetiancharacterisation of limited M capacity introduced by\\nPascual-Leone (1970) and developed by Case et al. (1982).According to the more cognitive account advanced byCase et al., the total processing space available to anindividual can be ﬂexibly deployed as either processing orstorage space. The suggestion is that total storage spaceremains constant over development, but that the op-erational eﬃciency of an individual—at executing strate-gies and processing incoming information, for example—increases, releasing storage space. The task employed byCase et al. to explore this theory was counting span, inwhich children counted the number of objects in aparticular display, and then attempted to recall in correctserial order the number of objects in the precedingdisplays. Operational eﬃciency was assessed by mea-suring the amount of time it took the child to repeat aword they had just heard. Using these techniques, Case etal. provided evidence for a linear relationship betweenoperational eﬃciency and memory span in children agedbetween 2 and 6 years; as speed of repetition increased sodid memory span, consistent with the view that withincreasingage the processing demandsdiminish, releasingstorage space. In a further study, Case et al. also foundthat once diﬀerences in operational eﬃciency were con-trolled across children and adults (by requiring adults tocount in an unfamiliar language), span diﬀerences dis-appeared. This, they argued, ﬁts well with the notion of aconstant limit to processing space across all ages. In-dependent evidence that counting span provides ameasure of working memory capacity that has directimpact on everyday cognitive activities is provided byYuill, Oakhill, and Parkin (1989), who found thatchildren with poor reading comprehension abilities haddeﬁcits in counting span. Thus in children as well as inadults, these capacity limitations appear to constraincomplex comprehension processes.\\nThe majority of research on complex working memory\\ntasksfocuses on language processing and comprehension,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='2e997bc1-ed05-4376-80e2-05c7074d2474', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '12', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='14 S. E. GATHERCOLE\\nFigure 4. Mean number of items correct on complex working memory task, as a\\nfunction of age group. Based on data from Siegel (1994).\\nand this raises some important issues concerning theor-\\netical interpretation of the data. One such issue is whethercomplex working memory measures and immediateverbal memory span tasks both simply tap the phono-logical loop. This can clearly be ruled out on severalgrounds.First,Hitch,Halliday,andLittler(1989)showedthat the contributions of Case et al.’s measure ofoperational eﬃciency, item identiﬁcation time, and thephonological loop to immediate memory span can bedissociated experimentally (although see Kail & Park,1994, for diﬀerent conclusions based on a correlationalapproach). Second, Oakhill, Yuill, and Parkin (1986)failed to ﬁnd any diﬀerences between children or goodand poor reading comprehension abilities on measures ofsimple memory span, although working memory spandeﬁcits have been found in the poor comprehensiongroup (Yuill et al., 1989). Third, complex workingmemory measures show consistently higher associationswith language comprehension than do simple memoryspan measures (Daneman & Merikle, 1996). Fourth,complex and simple span tasks show dissociable ageingeﬀects in adulthood: complex span diminishes from earlyto late adulthood, whereas simple span is maintained(Siegel, 1994). Finally, Morra (1994) administered a wide\\nrange of both complex and simple working memory tasksto a large sample of children, and found that individualvariability in the complex tasks such as counting spanand backward digit span was relatively independent ofvariability in simple memory span across children. Thus,complex and simple memory span appear to havedissociable origins within short-term working memory.\\nA further issue, which cannot be answered so readily, is\\nwhether complex memory span tasks represent a com-ponent of the central executive that is highly specialisedfor the analysis of language rather than a general purposeprocessing system. Daneman and Merikle (1996) proposethat the equivalent degree of association betweenmeasures of language comprehension and both verbaland ‘‘math’’-based (e.g. counting span) complex spanmeasures rules out an account of the links in terms of aprocessing system speciﬁc to the storage and manipu-lation of verbal material. This interpretation is not,however, unproblematic as counting, too, is a verballymediated task.

Whether the actual capacity of thesystem increases or not cannot be determined unambig-uously: one possibility is that the total resource (oramount of activation, in Just & Carpenter’s 1992 terms)increases developmentally; another possibility is thatprocessing demands diminish, thereby allowing the sys-tem to achieve more on a resource limitation that remainsconstant across time (Case et al., 1982). An equallyimportant issue is what impact individual and devel-opmental diﬀerences in the capacity of the centralexecutive have for everyday cognitive activities. Onepossibility is that a child with poor working memorycapacity will experience learning disabilities of a non-speciﬁc nature, and that executive capacity limitationsmay be particularly inﬂuential in preventing childrenwith more speciﬁc learning disabilities such as dyslexiafrom developing alternative strategies to support theirlearning (Swanson, 1993).\\nLong-term Memory\\nWe have seen above that children, like adults, have\\nwell-marked capacities to retain and manipulate manydiﬀerent types of information in short-term memory, andthat diﬀerences in these capacities may have directconsequences for the individual’s child’s abilities to learnin many diﬀerent ways. So, there appear to be importantlinksbetweenshort-termmemoryandlong-termlearning.But what about children’s long-term memory? The term‘‘long-term memory’’ is used here to refer to memory forevents that occurred hours, days, months, and years ago.What distinguishes long-term memory used in this wayfrom learning is that it refers not to memory for repeatedevents, but instead for single distant episodes. This typeof memory is almost always incomplete, and has nottypically been associated with any conscious attempt to‘‘learn’’.\\nA number of distinct memory systems or processes\\nappear to support long-term memory for previous events,although the diﬀerent components and their relationshipto one another are generally less well understood than isthe case for short-term memory. One important dis-tinction, made originally by Tulving (1972), is betweensemantic and episodic memory. The term semanticmemory refers to the near-permanent knowledge that wehave about the world—for example, our understandingof the meaning of individual words, our knowledge of ournames, and of facts. Semantic memory is characterised bya lack of recollection about the speciﬁc occasions onwhich the semantic knowledge was established; these arethings that we just ‘‘know’’. Episodic memory, on theother hand, refers to our memories for speciﬁc episodespreviously experienced; our memories for such events areoften accompanied by the phenomenal experience ofrecollective experience (Tulving, 1983).\\nThe principal focus of this part of the review is on the\\naspect of long-term memory that Tulving characterisedas ‘‘episodic’’. Further distinctions are necessary to\\ncharacterise the salient features of development of long-term memory. For the present purposes, the term episodicmemory will be reserved for memory for events that tookplace relatively recently in time—earlier this morning,yesterday, and maybe even last week. Over these (inlifetime terms) relatively small timescales, we are rathergoodatbeingabletoretrieveinformationaboutmundaneaspects of our lives, such as the food we ate at a particularmeal, where we parked the car, and who we stood with inthe elevator. The majority of experimental studies oflong-term memory take place over such relatively shortperiods, but typically lack much of the self-involvementof long-term, personally salient, episodic memories.Typical episodic memory paradigms involve participantsseeing or hearing lists of words, listening to a story, orseeing an enactment of an event in which they play norole. As a consequence, episodic memory as tested in theexperimental laboratory is characterised by low self-reference (the participant is usually a passive observer),and rarely yields a personal interpretation in the par-ticipant (Conway, 1990, 1996).\\nIn everyday life, of course, speciﬁc events are remem-\\nbered over much longer periods, up to years and decades.Thus, we can often recall some features of salient eventsthat took place a long time ago, such as moving house, aparticularly impactful conversation with a colleague, awedding, or a car accident. Our memories of such eventsis almost always incomplete, in that we remember muchless material than we would if the event had taken placeearlier today. Some important information, however,endures over long periods of time, and allows us toreminisce. This type of remembering of genuine events,which can take place over many years, is termed ‘‘auto-biographical memory’’. Autobiographical memory ishigh in self-reference, and frequently accompanied by apersonal interpretation, in contrast to laboratory-testedepisodic memory described above (Conway, 1990, 1996).There appear to be at least three highly signiﬁcant aspectsof autobiographical memory knowledge: speciﬁc events,general classes of events, and lifetime periods, which areorganised hierarchically (Conway, 1990). These diﬀerentsources of knowledge are combined at ‘‘remembering’’ toconstruct the dynamic representations of speciﬁc eventsthat correspond to our phenomenal experience of beingabletoremembera distantevent(Conway,1996; Conway& Rubin, 1993; Neisser, 1962).\\nThe past decade or so has seen a surge in interest in the\\ndevelopment during childhood of both episodic memoryand autobiographical memory, motivated both by theor-etical concerns and by the increasing need to gauge thevalidity of testimony by children in the courtroom incases relating to child abuse. Below, signiﬁcant ﬁndingsand advances in understanding both aspects of long-termmemory will be presented and evaluated. One of themajor diﬃculties in this area is that for psycholegalpurposes we need to understand constraints on children’sautobiographical memory: memory for events in whichthe child was centrally involved and which often evoke ahighly emotional response. In practice, the study of realautobiographical memories in children is beset withmethodological problems arising from lack of experi-mental control.

E. GATHERCOLE\\nmajority of research on this topic has employed labora-\\ntory-based paradigms, which allow greater experimentalrigour but which have the characteristics of low self-reference and personal interpretation that clearly identifythem as assessing episodic rather than autobiographicalmemory. Thus, the impact of many ﬁndings from thelaboratory for the development of autobiographicalmemory is still largely unknown.\\nThe Development of Autobiographical Memory\\nOne extremely important feature of autobiographical\\nmemory, which establishes that there are major de-velopmental changes in this type of remembering, is thephenomenon known as ‘‘ childhood amnesia’’. This termrefers to the fact, ﬁrst reported by Henri and Henri in1897 (see Nelson, 1993a), that it is extremely unusual foran individual to be able to retrieve memories about eventsthat took place before 2 years of age, and that memoriesfor the period between about 2 and 5 years are relativelyinfrequent. In a recent inﬂuential re-evaluation of child-hood amnesia, Pillemer and White (1989) obtained anaverage age of the earliest retrieved memory as 3 ±5 years,\\nwith a range from 2 to 8 years for the earliest memoryacross individuals.\\nThis scarcity of memories for events in the earliest\\nyears of life can be diﬃcult to interpret. In most cases, itis not possible to validate the date of origin of the earliestmemories, nor to rule out the possibility that an in-dividual actually remembers later descriptions by othersof the key event, or other external prompts such asphotographs. A number of studies have, however, foundclear evidence of the usual childhood amnesia phenom-enon when memories for events were sampled that had aknown date of occurrence, such as the birth of a sibling(Sheingold & Tenney, 1982; Usher & Neisser, 1993) andevents of national importance (Winograd & Killinger,1983). Also, dependence on memories for others re-counting stories of early childhood or on other externalsources of support is clearly insuﬃcient to explain themarkeddistributionofthe memoriesoverearlychildhoodin itself, with the absolute absence of memories for eventsprior to 2 years of age. Thus, childhood amnesia appearsto represent a valid phenomenon.\\nA number of memory-based accounts of childhood\\namnesia have been advanced. One possibility that hasnow been discounted is that the phenomenon is simply afunction of forgetting, with the most distant memories ofone’s life more subject to forgetting than subsequentones. It has been ruled out both by observations that theperiod of childhood amnesia does not ‘‘spread’’ withincreasing age of the rememberer, and by demonstrationsof the failure of mathematical models of forgetting topredict the dearth of memories prior to 5 years of age(Wetzler & Sweeney, 1986).\\nAnother general account of childhood amnesia is that\\nadults’ failures to retrieve memories from early childhoodand infancy reﬂects not the absence of memory records ortraces, but their inaccessibility. As discussed earlier,remembering memories of personal events that occurredmany years ago is not simply a passive act of retrieval, butis instead a reconstructive process in which diﬀerent typesof knowledge about the structure of events and one’s lifeis applied to incomplete memory traces to generate a\\nstable representation (Conway, 1996; Neisser, 1962).Neisser suggested that the adult ‘‘schemas’’ applied atretrieval will fail to make sense of the fragments availablefor early childhood events, and that this ‘‘schema-mismatch’’ is the source of childhood amnesia. A moredetailed version of this account is considered later in thissection.\\nOther more speciﬁc accounts of the changes in\\nchildren’s memories during the early part of life and theways in which these changes may contribute to childhoodamnesia have been advanced in recent years. An in-ﬂuential research team headed by Nelson have proposedthat autobiographical memories are not formed duringthe childhood amnesia period, and that is why they arenot subsequently available for retrieval in childhood(Nelson & Gruendel, 1981). Analyses of children’s mem-ories for events within this critical period of later infancyand the preschool years have yielded mixed results withrespect to this hypothesis. There is certainly someevidence that young children are much better at des-cribing the features of familiar, repeated events such asgoing to nursery and having lunch at MacDonalds thanat recalling details of speciﬁc incidents that occurred justonce (Hudson, 1986; Hudson & Nelson, 1986; Nelson,1978; Nelson & Gruendel, 1981; Nelson & Ross, 1980).Such ﬁndings led to the proposal that, during the earlyyears of life, children incorporate their ongoing experi-ences into frames of knowledge for familiar events or‘‘scripts’’, such as going to nursery and eating atMacDonalds, but do not (unlike older children andadults) retain details of speciﬁc incidents. By this account,information about speciﬁc details of events that departfrom the routine are only retained in an emergingautobiographical memory system by about 4 years of age,when the child has developed an extensive repertoire ofgeneric knowledge about the event structure of their life.Nelson (1993a, b) argues that such an evolving system isan eﬃcient use of the child’s cognitive resources, as beforesuch generic knowledge has been accumulated, it is notpossible for children to judge what is and what is notunusual, and therefore they cannot eﬀectively judge whatfeatures of an episode to store in memory.\\nThe problem for the simple view, that children do not\\nhave detailed autobiographical memories for speciﬁc in-cidents during the period of childhood amnesia, is thatit is at odds with a considerable amount of other evidence.Nelson’s (1989) own transcripts and analysis of thebedtime talk of an infant Emily between the ages of 19and 37 months provides substantial evidence that, at leastover short timescales of a day or less, Emily was able torecall many detailed features of the day’s activities. Andon a larger timescale, Fivush and Hamond (1990) foundthat at 2 ±5 years, many children had memories of events\\nthat took place 6 months previously and that at 4 years,some children were able to recall events from 2 yearsof age.\\nTo account for such ﬁndings, Nelson (1993a, b) pro-\\nposed that children’s early memories of recent events areserved not by autobiographical memory, but by a short-term holding system for recent events—episodic memory.Thus, Emily’s crib talk reﬂects use of this system. Howthen can children, on occasion, remember details of\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='9c73f577-14ad-4d2d-bc80-4f1e10355db8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '15', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='17 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nFigure 5.

Nelson suggests that this might beachieved by the reinstatement of previous event contexts,which appears to prolong very substantially the amountof time that information can be preserved in episodicmemory even in young infants. Several studies have nowdemonstrated that reinstatement, or the re-presentationof an earlier event some time after its initial occurrence,will eﬀectively extend a child’s memory for that event(Bauer, Hertsgaard, & Wewarka, 1995; Boller, Rovee-Collier, Gulya, & Prete, 1996; Fivush & Hamond, 1989;Rovee-Collier, Sullivan, Enright, Lucas, & Fagen, 1980).\\nNelson’s (1993a, b) views of the changes that take place\\nin the types of memory knowledge or systems available tosupport remembering of distant events are summarisedschematically in Fig. 5. In the pre-autobiographical stagethat characterises the infancy and preschool period,memory is supported by two systems, episodic memoryand generic memory. Repeated encounters with similarevents allow access to the generic memory system.Subsequently, in the ‘‘post-autobiographical system’’,autobiographical memory emerges and interacts withsemantic, generic, and episodic memory to provide adynamic and ﬂexible system for remembering both recentand distant events. Why, though, does autobiographicalmemory emerge when it does?\\nUsing a social-interactional framework, Fivush,\\nNelson, and colleagues suggest that autobiographicalmemory emerges because children learn to talk abouttheir memories and learn how to formulate memories asnarratives. Fivush, Haden, and Reese (1996) provide\\nevidence that although adults engage children as youngas 2 years and below in conversations involvingreminiscence of shared events, the young child makeslittle substantive contribution to the collective activity ofremembering, even when cued. By 4 years of age,however, the typical child shows considerable com-petence in talking within the narrative structure ap-propriate for shared reminiscence (Fivush, Haden, &Adam, 1995). Fivush et al. (1996) identify two possiblecontributors to this emerging competence. First, adultsgradually introduce children to richer and more complexways of talking about earlier events. Second, the child’sincreasing facility at language provides the opportunityfor restructuring and understanding past experiences in away that more closely approximates to the adult narrativeform. Via these and other processes, it is proposed that acoherent and organised autobiographical memory systemcan eventually be developed and used from 4 yearsonwards, with increasing eﬀectiveness for supportingmemory for distant events.\\nIn an important test of whether narrative coherence in\\ntalking about memories heralds the end of childhoodamnesia, Pillemer, Picariello, and Pruett (1994) provideda detailed investigation of whether the degree of narrativestructuring of young children’s memory for a recentautobiographical event predicts the likelihood of recall ofthe same event 7 years later.

As a result, the children were evacuatedfrom the building, following the emergency procedure.Pillemer et al. tested the children’s memories for thisexciting event 2 weeks later and then again after a delay of7 years. The most interesting aspect of the ﬁndings relatedto the subdivision of the children as either 3 or 4 years atthe time of the original event, two age groups whichprobably straddle the boundary to the childhood amnesiaperiod. Seven years later, 57% of the older groupproduced either an intact or fragmentary memory of theevent, whereas only 18% of the younger group were ableto do so. Similarly, whereas 86% of the older groupselected the correct location of classroom from whichthey were evacuated in a forced-choice test, the youngerchildren performed at chance level on this measure. Thusdespite the very long period intervening between theevent and the later unexpected memory test, the 1-yearage diﬀerence at original experience between the youngerand older preschool children had powerful consequencesfor the much later memory of this real-life event.\\nPillemer et al. (1994) propose that these ﬁndings align\\nreadily with the ‘‘cognitive developmental’’ approach tochildhood amnesia (Pillemer, 1992; Pillemer & White,1989; Usher & Neisser, 1993), according to which thepossibility and quality of later recall is dependent uponthe degree of correspondence between the cognitivemechanisms in place at the time of experiencing theoriginal event and attempting to recollect it. Pillemer etal. suggest that the principal constraining factor atoriginal experience was the degree of causal understand-ing of the narrative structure of the event, with the olderchildren showing superior understanding of the relation-ship of the diﬀerent components of the event to oneanother. So the greater the narrative coherence at thetime, the more organised the resulting memory trace andthe closer the match with the narrative schemas applied tointerpret the incomplete memory traces many years later.\\nA rather diﬀerent perspective on the development of\\nautobiographical memory has recently been advanced byHowe and Courage (1997). They propose that auto-biographical memory is present typically by 2 years ofage, considerably earlier than Nelson’s (1993a, b) es-timate of 4 years. According to Howe and Courage,autobiographical memory is present as soon as the‘‘cognitive self’’, or the awareness of oneself as havingspeciﬁc cognitive capacities, emerges at between 18 and24 months. A key feature of this account is that there is nodevelopmental discontinuity in memory systems priorand subsequent to the emergence of autobiographicalmemory. Rather, basic memory systems are in place fromearly infancy, and the organising structure of the cog-nitive self acts upon these to generate autobiographicalmemories. Increases in the accuracy of autobiographicalmemory subsequent to 2 years are attributed to a varietyof developmental changes including increased linguisticproﬁciency and narrative knowledge, and memorystorage capacity.\\nIn addition to these general developmental factors that\\nappear to govern the quality and quantity of auto-biographical memories in childhood, emotional experi-ence appears to play a critical role in the establishment ofenduring autobiographical memories at this stage. Thedegreeoftrauma associatedwithapersonallyexperienced\\nevent has a substantial impact on a young child’ssubsequent memories. Ornstein (1995) found superiorrecall in children of experiencing an unpleasant medicalprocedure than of a routine visit to a doctor. Similarly,Hamond and Fivush (1990) obtained recall protocolsfrom young children for their experience of HurricaneAndrew; these contained over twice the degree of detailas did a comparable group of children’s recall of a familytrip to Disneyworld. These and other ﬁndings indicatethat, in children as in adults, the degree of personalinvolvement and emotional experience accompanying anevent are important determinants of its memorability(Conway, 1995).\\nThe evidence presented in this section attests to major\\ndevelopmental changes in the organisation of autobio-graphical memory in the early childhood years. As adultswe remember very little from these years (childhoodamnesia). Children clearly do remember some speciﬁcdetails of distant events during the period of up to 4 yearsor so, but there is some indication that their recall of thememories tends to be either lacking in speciﬁc detail orfragmentary and disorganised at this time. Theoristsdisagree according to whether the changes over theseyears reﬂect the initial absence and then eventual emerg-ence of an autobiographical memory system (Nelson,1993a, b) or gradual changes to the ways in which thechild organises his or her experience (Howe & Courage,1997; Usher & Neisser, 1993). Either way, the conse-quences for the amount and coherence of materialremembered from earlier incidents is clearly subject toenormous change during the period extending frominfancy to the preschool years.\\nOne concern is that the conclusion that preschoolers’\\nmemories are relatively lacking in both detail andcoherence nonetheless stands in direct conﬂict with theviews of parents and carers that, as early as 2 years of age,children produce complex and detailed narrativeaccounts of prior events. Could it simply be that lack ofdetail and coherence of the memories is a product of themethodologies used for obtaining memory protocols ofyoung children, which typically involve an unfamiliarperson asking the child to remember a particular event? Itis at least possible that a close family member would bemore successful in eliciting more ‘‘mature’’ memoriesfrom 2- and 3-year-old children. If this was found to bethe case, the clear implication would be that the com-plexity of young children’s accounts of previous eventsmay be limited not by long-term memory but by lack ofdevelopment of social narrative skills to guide theirinteractions with strangers.\\nThe Development of Episodic Memory\\nThe body of evidence reviewed above identiﬁes im-\\nportant developments in the child’s abilities over thepreschool period to remember speciﬁc past events and toorganise recall of those events. By school age, the typicalchild shows good skills both at recalling details of priorexperiencesand at organising those detailsinto a coherentnarrative form. Age aﬀects not only the child’s currentcapacity to remember, but also the likelihood of futuresuccessfulrecall.Memoriesformed at thisage andbeyond\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ac0441fa-79b9-4c3f-a11e-ab0a28a006d2', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '17', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='19 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nstand a much better chance of surviving the test of years\\nand being recalled in adulthood than memories for earlierexperiences.\\nIn emphasising the growing maturity of children’s\\nrecollections over the early childhood period, though, it iseasy to lose sight of the fact that even very young childrenin infancy and early childhood are nonetheless capable ofremembering and learning many diﬀerent things. Anyonewho has had regular close contact with children betweenbirth and 2 years of age will know that even at these veryyoung ages, children frequently demonstrate surprisingand impressive abilities to remember events which haveoften only been experienced on a single occasion. In thesection below, some recent research designed to addressthis issue is outlined.\\nNonverbal memory in infancy and early childhood .\\nOne inﬂuential group has conducted pioneering studiesof children’s memories for single distant events experi-enced as infants and toddlers, and has concluded fromtheir studies that these memory abilities are served by thesame memory system that contributes to remembering inolder children and adults (e.g., Bauer & Mandler, 1989;Meltzoﬀ, 1988). These researchers used a nonverbalmethod for assessing the memories of very young andlargely preverbal children, known as the elicited imitationparadigm. In this paradigm, the child observes theexperimenter using props to model a single action or anaction sequence. Examples of action sequences are ‘‘putFozzy bear to bed’’ and ‘‘make a windmill’’ (Bauer et al.,1995). The props are then given to the child, who isencouraged to imitate the action. The degree of cor-respondence between the child’s sequences of actionswith the props and the original modelled sequence is thenscored, providing a measure of the extent to which thechild remembered the experimenter’s actions. Typically,the child’s ‘‘recall’’ is sampled after a delay that mayrange from hours to years.\\nThis paradigm has yielded clear evidence that infants\\nand toddlers do retain a considerable amount of in-formation about earlier events. At 14 months of age,recall can survive a delay of 1 week (Meltzoﬀ, 1988), andsome 13-month-old children can remember multi-stepsequences up to 6 weeks later. Even more impressively,recollection of action sequences witnessed on a singleoccasion only has been found to persist for 8 to 12 monthsin 2-year old children (Bauer, Hertsgaard, & Dow, 1994;McDonough & Mandler, 1994).\\nYoung children’s performance on the elicited imitation\\nparadigm is sensitive to at least two important factors.First, the amount of information remembered by thechild is increased and the period of time over which it isretained is prolonged if the child passively witnesses theoriginal event in full or in part after a considerable delay.This eﬀect of reinstatement has now been demonstratedon many occasions (Fivush, 1984; Hudson, 1986, 1990;Sheﬃeld & Hudson, 1994), and remarkably was found byBauer et al. (1995) to operate even when the reinstatementconsists simply of a verbal reminder to 15-month-olds ofthe action sequence accompanied by the props, and notby full re-enactment of the sequence. As noted earlier,similar beneﬁts of reinstatement have also been found inconditioned learning by very young infants (Boller et al.,1996; Hill, Borovsky, & Rovee-Collier, 1988; Rovee-Collier & Fagen, 1981); reinstatement may be one of the\\nmechanisms by which information is transferred from arelatively fragile (in terms of temporal duration, at least)memory holding system into a more durable memoryreserve.\\nA second factor inﬂuencing recall in the event memory\\ntask is the degree to which the component actions in themodelled action sequence are constrained or enabled byone another. For example, the components in an actionsequence containing novel events may have either ar-bitrary relations of one to another (as in ‘‘make a funnyclown’’, which involved various objects that can beapplied to a face shape in any sequence). Alternatively,they could have enabling relations in which the sequencethe actions are performed in is critical to achieving theend state (as in ‘‘make a spinning top’’, which involvesplacing toy horses on a base, aﬃxing a plunger, andpressing the plunger to make the horses spin). Recall issuperior for the latter ‘‘enabling relations’’ type of events,establishing that in very young children at least, repre-sentations of arbitrarily ordered events in memory arenot well organised and do not eﬀectively support laterrecall (Bauer & Fivush, 1992; Bauer et al., 1995; Hudson& Nelson, 1986).\\nOn the basis of this and other evidence, Bauer et al.\\n(1994) and McDonough and Mandler (1994) have arguedstrongly for continuity in the memory systems under-pinning memory for speciﬁc distant events from infancythrough to the verbally mediated recall which emergeslater. A close look at individual studies using thisapproach, however, reveals substantial inconsistencies inﬁndings. For example, McDonough and Mandler (1994)found that 2-year-olds returning to the laboratory after a1-year delay showed evidence of recalling a familiarmodelled action (of feeding Teddy with a schematicbottle) but not of remembering sequences of unfamiliaractions. In contrast, Bauer et al. (1994) found thattoddlers of a similar age recalled novel event sequences(such as ‘‘make a rattle’’), but not familiar sequences(‘‘feeding Teddy’’), 8 months later. Why opposite eﬀectsshould be found across the two studies is as yet unclear.Furthermore, Boyer, Barron, and Farrar (1994) failed toobtain any evidence, in either verbal protocols or non-verbal imitation, of memory in 2-year-old children of anactivity (making PlayDoh spaghetti) learned over a yearpreviously. This result is clearly at odds with otherﬁndings. More generally, it seems likely that detailedproﬁles of memory performance, including retentionfunctions, which emerge from the elicited imitationstudies, may be highly speciﬁc to the particular memorysequences used. Without some degree of harmonisationof stimuli and methods, it may be premature to drawgeneral conclusions about decay functions and devel-opmental changes in long-term memory from this para-digm.\\nNelson (1994) has challenged the view that the elicited\\nimitation task demonstrates that very young childrenhave access to the same long-term memory system asolder children and adults. Nelson pointed out that inperforming this task, infants and toddlers need not bedrawing upon an explicit long-term memory system inwhich remembering is accompanied by conscious aware-ness. Rather, very young children’s ‘‘recall’’ of modelled\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='31949272-105e-48f1-91b5-431a8c54a4a1', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '18', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='20 S. E. GATHERCOLE\\nsequences may be mediated by an implicit memory system\\nthat allows for later actions to be inﬂuenced by earlierexperiences in the absence of any conscious recollection(see Schacter, 1987). In other words, Nelson’s suggestionwas that young children are drawing upon a primitivelearning system in the elicited imitation paradigm, ratherthan the episodic or autobiographical memory systemsthat she considers to support memory in preschool andolder children (Nelson, 1993a).\\nIt is relevant at this point to note that in the elicited\\nimitation task, the child passively witnesses the modellingof fairly arbitrary action sequences. This passive natureof the to-be-remembered episode may in itself contributeto a substantial underestimation of the capacities ofyoung children to remember previous events. It is alreadyknown that active participation in an event enhanceschildren’s recall (Rudy & Goodman, 1991) and this maybe because the event, by virtue of its high self-referenceand personal relevance, is represented in autobiographi-cal rather than episodic memory (Conway, 1990, 1996).The paradigms described in the previous section, in whichchildren were later asked to recall events in which theyplayed an integral role, such as evacuating a building inan emergency (Pillemer et al., 1994), or a visit to anarchaeological museum (Hudson & Fivush, 1991), aresimilarly meaningful to the child. In contrast, the neutralaction sequences employed in the elicited imitation task,modelled by another, will be much lower in self-relevanceto the children, and are unlikely to elicit a personalinterpretation. Thus the elicited imitation paradigm andmemory tasks that require recall of real-life episodes maydraw upon fundamentally diﬀerent memory systems. Forthis reason alone, direct comparison of long-term mem-oryabilitiesofvery youngandolderchildren,confoundedas they are both by paradigm and age of the child at test,is probably neither possible nor appropriate.\\nAlthough the studies of long-term memory in very\\nyoung children reviewed above may not provide a con-vincing demonstration that the same memory systemsare in place across the full range of the childhood yearsfrom infancy onwards, the ﬁndings are nonetheless im-portant. They securely establish that young children cansometimes retain information from speciﬁc episodes oververy long periods of time. We are, however, a long wayfrom being able to predict in advance what particularinformation a child of a particular age is likely to retainover diﬀerent periods of time: this is highly dependent onmany detailed aspects of the nature of the memory event,as well as known sources of individual diﬀerences such asgender, parental style of communication, and languageability (Fivush et al., 1996; Nelson, 1993a, b; Reese,Haden, & Fivush, 1993).\\nEyewitness testimony . The need to understand the\\nquality of children’s memory for distant events hasbecome imperative in recent years as a consequence ofincreasing dependence on testimony provided by childwitnesses in the courtroom in cases relating to childabuse, domestic violence, and crime in schools. Appro-priate interpretation of such evidence clearly requiresevaluation of the reliability of children’s memory, and ofthe developmental changes that occur. As a result of thesepsycholegal needs, a new tradition of the study ofchildren’s ‘‘eyewitness memory’’ has emerged. The prin-cipal issues guiding research in this area: are: (1) whether\\nthere are age diﬀerences in the reliability of children’smemory for experienced events, (2) whether there are agediﬀerences in the susceptibility of children to misleadingsuggestions made by others, and (3) which are the bestmethods of obtaining unbiased memories from children.\\nMost of the research on children’s eyewitness memory\\nuses ‘‘episodic memory’’ type paradigms in which thechild either sees an enactment of an event or hears a storyin which he or she is not an active participant. Consistentwith the ﬁndings of other laboratory studies and investi-gations of children’s autobiographical memories re-viewed above, it has been demonstrated on manyoccasions that in these tasks young children (and es-pecially preschool children) recall considerably less of thetarget events than either older children or adults (e.g.Cohen & Harnick, 1980; King & Yuille, 1987; Oates &Shrimpton, 1991; Ornstein, Gordon, & Larus, 1992).The implication is that young children have relativelyimpoverished memory representations of events, possiblyarising from poor understanding of the causal structureof the events (Pillemer et al., 1994).\\nAdults’ memory for witnessed events is of course also\\nfallible, and has been shown on many occasions to beliable to distortion by misleading post-event information(e.g. Loftus, 1979). Using the eyewitness testimonyparadigm developed by Loftus, in which a memory eventis followed by some ‘‘questions’’ that incorporate in-accurate information, it has been found that youngchildren (of about 6 years and below) are even morevulnerable to distortion following exposure to misleadinginformation about the memory event than are olderchildren and adults. For example, Ceci, Ross, and Toglia(1987) presented to children a story about a girl who hada stomachache from eating her breakfast too fast.Subsequently, the children were asked a biased question:‘‘Do you remember the story about Loren ,the girl who had\\na headache because she ate her cereal too fast ?’’. Still later,\\nthe children were given a forced-choice recognition taskinvolving two pictures; in one, Loren was eating hercereal and in the other (incorrect one), she had aheadache. In this experiment, the probability of makingcorrect recognition judgements was lower for such biasedthan unbiased information, and the extent of the biasingdecrement decreased regularly from the younger (3–4years) to the older (10–12 years) children. In a recentreview, Ceci and Bruck (1993) found such evidence ofincreased suggestibility to misleading information inyounger children in 88% of such eyewitness testimonystudies. According to Ceci (1995, p. 155, original italics),‘‘there arereliable age diﬀerence in suggestibility, with\\npreschool children’s reports being more readily impededby the presence of erroneous suggestions by an inter-viewer than older children’s reports’’.\\nThe implication of these ﬁndings is that the integrity of\\nyoung children’s memories for real-life events is unlikelyto survive detailed questioning in and out of the court-room. Ceci, Huﬀman, and Smith (1994) attempted tosimulate this by asking children to think, repeatedly overa 10-week period, about both real events and events thatnever happened. For example, a false event could be cuedby the interviewer saying to the child ‘‘ Think real hard ,\\nand tell me if this ever happened to you .Can you ever\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='ebd18d9c-48fd-4845-a132-55bbe65a0d76', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='21 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nremember going to hospital with a mousetrap on your\\nﬁnger?’’. Over the period of the study, 58% of preschool\\nchildren produced false narratives and at least one falseevent description, and a quarter of the children respondedwith ‘‘memories’’ to the majority of the ﬁctionalisedevent descriptions. So, mere exposure to adults askingyou about events that did not take place is clearlysuﬃcient under some circumstances to yield false mem-ories. Possibly most troubling of all, Ceci et al. videotapedthe children in this experiment being given a forensic-styleinterview about both real and false events, and showedthe tapes to psychologists specialising in children’stestimony. These professionals were no better thanchance at discriminating children’s recounting of trueover false memories.\\nThe evidence reviewed so far indicates that young\\nchildren have both relatively poor event memory andhigh suggestibility to misleading information. For adetailed analysis of the roots of this comparatively lowreliability of preschoolers’ memories, it is useful toconsider possible mechanisms for suggestibility eﬀects.Loftus, Schooler, and Wagenaar (1985) suggested thatpost-event information (such as a biasing question) maydestructively update the original memory trace, replacingthe original target information with the later biasinginformation. Quite plausibly, it could be argued that thelower levels of organisation and integration of infor-mation within the original memory trace in youngerchildren might be particularly low in resistance to suchupdating. Another mechanism considered by Loftus et al.is that the subsequent biased material is retained in acoexisting memory with the original information, butthat possibly as a consequence of its more recent date itsuppresses access to incompatible material in the earliermemory trace, and hence leads to biasing errors. Toaccount for the greater degree of suggestibility of youngchildren via this mechanism, it would be necessary tomake the rather arbitrary assumption that the inhibitoryeﬀect of the later memory on access to the originalmemory trace is more severe in younger children.\\nThere are, however, a range of other possible mechan-\\nisms for memory suggestibility eﬀects that make muchless strong claims about the impact of later events onoriginal memory representations, and that may, in fact,all plausibly contribute to the observed developmentalchanges in degree of susceptibility to misleading in-formation. McCloskey and Zaragoza (1985; see alsoZaragoza & Lane, 1994) suggested that the later biasedinformation does not either distort or deny access to theoriginal memory information, but instead is used to ﬁll ingaps in incompletely speciﬁed memory traces. Thus invery young children, who we already know have par-ticularly poorly speciﬁed memories, the probability ofmisleading information being used in this way to com-plete earlier memories will be particularly high.\\nA related view is that the increased suggestibility of\\nyoung children reﬂects their response to the demandcharacteristics of the memory situation, in which thechild is provided with new information by the adultexperimenter, an authority ﬁgure (Poole & Lindsay,1995). Thus the child may assume that the post-eventsuggestions are valid and so consciously base theirresponses on the suggestions rather than the original, andpossibly conﬂicting, memories. In Ceci et al.’s (1994)\\nsimulated false memory situation, the child may simplyassume that if the experimenter thinks that he or she wentto hospital attached to a mousetrap, they must be right.Consistent with this compliance view, the impact ofbiasing post-event information on young children is nowknown to be reduced if its source is another child ratherthan an adult (Ceci, Leichtman, Putnick, & Nightingale,1993).\\nA further possibility is that the young child remembers\\nboth the critical detail of the original event and thecontent of the post-event suggestion (in the example ofthe Ceci et al. 1987 study, this would be the stomachacheand the headache), but is uncertain as to which detailoccurred in the original story. This represents a failure ofwhat has come to be known as source monitoring, or theability to discriminate between memories from diﬀerentsources. Young children have been found to make moreerrors than adults in discriminating between performedand imagined actions (Foley & Johnson, 1985; Foley,Johnson, & Raye, 1983; Lindsay, Johnson, & Kwon,1991), although these developmental diﬀerences in moni-toring do appear somewhat inconsistent across studies(e.g. Foley, Durso, Wilder, & Friedman, 1991; Roberts &Blades, 1995). There is certainly direct evidence thatsource confusions in eyewitness testimony tasks aregreater in younger than older children (Ackil & Zaragoza,1995), lending further weight to this suggestion that veryyoung children are not necessarily unduly misled, butinstead are often unable to remember what detail wassupplied by what source.\\nThus although the vulnerability of preschool children\\nto misinformation after the memory event is widelyaccepted, the causes for the apparent memory distortionsare still being keenly debated. It certainly seems plausiblethat much of the apparent distortion of their memoriesdoes not necessarily reﬂect alterations in the originalmemory representation, but other factors such as com-pliance to the suggestions of adult authority ﬁgures, anduncertainty about the precise source of rememberedinformation. Practical implications follow from thisanalysis. In particular, incorporating source monitoringquestions (e.g. ‘‘ did you see that happen ,or did somebody\\ntell you that it happened ?’’) into interviews with child\\nwitnesses should lead to an increase in the reliability oftheir testimony (Poole & Lindsay, 1995).\\nOn the other hand, some of the models increasingly\\nused by professionals in their interactions with childwitnesses may be counter-productive. The use of dollsand props in interviews are widely believed to enhanceremembering in young children, and to compensate tosome degree for the linguistic limitations of the youngwitness. However, preschool children have recently beenshown to have diﬃculty in using dolls as representationsof themselves (DeLoache & Marzolf, 1995). Moreover,although the introduction of props at recall may elicitmore information, there is little gain in the amount ofaccurate recall (Salmon, Bidrose, & Pipe, 1995). The factthat children use dolls and props when allowed thereforeprovides no guarantee of more accurate memory as-sessment.\\nThe main conclusions to emerge from this brief review\\nof children’s eyewitness testimony, of relatively poor\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='3bd8e7ac-0050-43f1-95ba-1b7bcd9b6b32', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, text='22 S. E. GATHERCOLE\\nlong-term memory and high levels of suggestibility in\\nyoung children, may be unduly pessimistic for tworeasons. First, the focus in the majority of studies iswhether there are age-related changes in children’sabilities to remember distant events. Although consistentdiﬀerences are found, in many cases they simply dem-onstrate that preschool children are relatively poorer at\\nremembering material than older children. This agediﬀerence notwithstanding, even very young childrenoften demonstrate very reliable memory performance,particularly when optimal methods of sampling memoryare used and there is no misleading information presentedsubsequently (Poole & Lindsay, 1995). Young childrenalso appear to be relatively resistant to biased questioningwhen the misleading information relates to a centralrather than peripheral feature of the original event(Pezdek & Roe, 1995). So, even preschool children arecapable of accurate memories given the right circum-stances.\\nThe second point relates to more general features of the\\nmethods used to assess children’s memories for distantspeciﬁc events. Although much of the research in this areais motivated by the need to understand the reliability oftheir testimony in court cases, the memory events thatthey feature diﬀer in many critical features from the real-life events they are designed to simulate. Eyewitnessmemory research depends largely upon laboratory-styleexperiments in which the child either hears a story orwatches a staged event of neutral emotional valence,typically as a passive bystander. In contrast, the eventswitnessed in real life by the traumatised child called toprovide witness are likely to be high in personal relevanceand emotional content, and may well have been repeatedon many occasions. So whereas eyewitness memoryexperiments tap episodic memory, in real life the child’stestimony is likely to be supported by the more powerfulautobiographical memory (Conway, 1990). Until thecontributing memory systems in the two circumstancesare aligned, it seems likely that we will inevitablyunderestimate the quality and organisation of youngchildren’s memories for important events.\\nKnowledge about Memory\\nThe primary emphasis of this article is on changes that\\ntake place in childhood in the capacity and functioning ofthree basic memory systems: short-term memory, auto-biographical memory, and episodic memory. Many otherimportant developments in memory also occur across thechildhood period, but are unfortunately beyond the scopeof the present review. One particular aspect of memorydevelopment that warrants at least a brief mention here is‘‘metamemory’’, which is the knowledge and awarenessthat an individual has about his or her own memory.Examples of activities involving metamemory includejudgements about whether one thing is likely to be easierto remember than something else, knowledge aboutwhether or not you are likely to be able to remembersomething some time in the future, and knowledge aboutwhether or not you already know a particular fact. Thetypes of metamemory possessed by children of diﬀerentages have important practical as well as theoreticalimplications, as the eﬀective training of strategies forenhancing memory performance requires the child to\\nhave some degree of awareness of how memory worksand how to inﬂuence this process (Pressley, Borkowski, &O’Sullivan, 1985).\\nStrong positive links between children’s metamemory\\njudgements and their actual memory performance hasnow been established in many tasks, demonstrating thatchildren are able to make reliable explicit judgementsabout the functioning and capacities of their basicmemory systems (Schneider, 1985). The degree ofsophistication of metamemory does, however, undergoconsiderable developmental change: the rudimentarymemory awareness demonstrated in preschool children(Schneider & Sodian, 1988) is superceded by increasingknowledge of both general and speciﬁc strategies formemory and learning which is more or less fully de-veloped by about 12 years (Schneider & Pressley, 1989,1997). Detailed accounts of the important changes inmetamemory and memory strategy training are providedby Forrest-Pressley, MacKinnon, and Waller (1985),Kail (1990), and Schneider and Pressley (1989, 1997).\\nConcluding Remarks\\nThe development of memory during childhood repre-\\nsents a crucial area of research both for cognitive anddevelopmental psychology. As indicated in the presentselective review of memory development, the emergencein recent years both of techniques for investigating a widerange of aspects of children’s memory function and ofnew theories of memory has mapped out importantterritory for investigation in coming years. It is importantto note, however, that it is not only the theoreticians whobeneﬁt from increased understanding of children’s mem-ory resulting from this substantial research eﬀort. Mem-ory functioning during childhood has many practicalimplications, too. Professional groups who work along-side children, such as teachers, educational psychologists,lawyers, and counsellors, also need to know aboutmemory development. Unless members of these pro-fessions can readily gain access to current understandingof children’s memory and of methods for its assessment,they will be limited in the extent to which they can, forexample, make reasonable evaluations of the likelyaccuracy of eyewitness evidence from a child of aparticular age, or judge the likely educational conse-quences for a child of a speciﬁc deﬁcit in memory.Memory researchers therefore have an important re-sponsibility not only to disseminate their ﬁndings to theimmediate research community, but also to the manyother interested parties who need to know aboutchildren’s memory for practical rather than theoreticalpurposes.\\nAcknowledgements— The preparation of this article was\\nsupported by a Medical Research Council programme grant on‘‘Working Memory and Learning Disability’’ awarded to AlanD.

The challenges and\\nopportunities of Social Media\\nAndreas M. Kaplan *, Michael Haenlein\\nESCP Europe, 79 Avenue de la Re ´publique, F-75011 Paris, France\\n1. The specter of Social Media\\nAs of January 2009, the online social networking\\napplication Facebook registered more than 175million active users. To put that number in perspec-tive, this is only slightly less than the population of\\nBrazil (190 million) and over twice the population of\\nGermany (80 million)! At the same time, everyminute, 10 hours of content were uploaded to thevideo sharing platform YouTube. And, the imagehosting site Flickr provided access to over 3 billionphotographs, making the world-famous LouvreMuseum’s collection of 300,000 objects seem tiny\\nin comparison.\\nAccording to Forrester Research, 75% of Internet\\nsurfers used ‘‘Social Media’’ in the second quarter of2008 by joining social networks, reading blogs, or\\ncontributing reviews to shopping sites; this repre-\\nsents a signiﬁcant rise from 56% in 2007. The growthis not limited to teenagers, either; members ofGeneration X, now 35—44 years old, increasinglypopulate the ranks of joiners, spectators, and crit-ics. It is therefore reasonable to say that SocialMedia represent a revolutionary new trend thatshould be of interest to companies operating in\\nonline space– —or any space, for that matter.\\nYet, not overly many ﬁrms seem to act comfort-\\nably in a world where consumers can speak so freely\\nBusiness Horizons (2010) 53, 59—68\\nwww.elsevier .com/locate/bushor\\nKEYWORDS\\nSocial Media;\\nUser Generated\\nContent;\\nWeb 2.0;Social networking sites;\\nVirtual worldsAbstract The concept of Social Media is top of the agenda for many business\\nexecutives today. Decision makers, as well as consultants, try to identify ways in\\nwhich ﬁrms can make proﬁtable use of applications such as Wikipedia, YouTube,\\nFacebook, Second Life, and T witter. Yet despite this interest, there seems to be verylimited understanding of what the term ‘‘Social Media’’ exactly means; this article\\nintends to provide some clariﬁcation. We begin by describing the concept of Social\\nMedia, and discuss how it differs from related concepts such as Web 2.0 and UserGenerated Content. Based on this deﬁnition, we then provide a classiﬁcation of SocialMedia which groups applications currently subsumed under the generalized term into\\nmore speciﬁc categories by characteristic: collaborative projects, blogs, content\\ncommunities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds, and virtual social worlds.Finally, we present 10 pieces of advice for companies which decide to utilize Social\\nMedia.\\n#2009 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Here, for example, cus-tomers can read that the 2007 model of Hasbro’sEasy-Bake Oven may lead to serious burns on chil-dren’s hands and ﬁngers due to a poorly-designedoven door , and that the Firestone Tire and Rubber\\nCompany has been accused of using child labor in its\\nLiberian rubber factory. Historically, companieswere able to control the information available aboutthem through strategically placed press announce-ments and good public relations managers. Today,however , ﬁrms have been increasingly relegated tothe sidelines as mere observers, having neither theknowledge nor the chance– —or , sometimes, even the\\nright– —to alter publicly posted comments provided\\nby their customers. Wikipedia, for example, ex-pressly forbids the participation of ﬁrms in its onlinecommunity.\\nSuch an evolution may not be surprising. After all,\\nthe Internet started out as nothing more than a giantBulletin Board System (BBS) that allowed users toexchange software, data, messages, and news with\\neach other . The late 1990s saw a popularity surge in\\nhomepages, whereby the Average Joe could shareinformation about his private life; today’s equivalentwould be the weblog, or blog. The era of corporateweb pages and e-commerce started relatively re-cently with the launch of Amazon and eBay in1995, and got a right ticking-off only 6 years laterwhen the dot-com bubble burst in 2001. The current\\ntrend toward Social Media can therefore be seen as an\\nevolution back to the Internet’s roots, since it re-transforms the World Wide Web to what it wasinitially created for: a platform to facilitate informa-tion exchange between users. But does that meanthat Social Media is just old wine in new bottles?Probably not! As we will delve into further , thetechnical advances that have been made over the\\npast 20 years now enable a form of virtual content\\nsharing that is fundamentally different from, andmore powerful than, the BBS of the late 1970s.\\nThis article discusses the challenges and opportu-\\nnities that emerge from this evolution for ﬁrms, andprovides structure to better understand the rapidlyevolving ﬁeld of Social Media. We begin by providing adeﬁnition and classiﬁcation of Social Media by looking\\nat their historical roots, technical speciﬁcities, and\\ndifferences from other entities such as Web 2.0 andUser Generated Content. We then focus on sixtypes of Social Media– —collaborative projects, blogs,content communities, social networking sites, virtual\\ngame worlds, and virtual social worlds– —and presentways in which companies can efﬁciently make use ofthese applications. Based on this analysis, we then\\nderive a set of 10 recommendations companies\\nshould follow when thinking about developing theirown Social Media strategy, be it with respect to theseaforementioned types or other applications whichmight emerge in the future.\\n2.

While applications\\nsuch as personal web pages, Encyclopedia BritannicaOnline, and the idea of content publishing belong tothe era of Web 1.0, they are replaced by blogs, wikis,and collaborative projects in Web 2.0. Although Web2.0 does not refer to any speciﬁc technical update ofthe World Wide Web, there is a set of basic function-alities that are necessary for its functioning. Among\\nthem are Adobe Flash (a popular method for adding\\nanimation, interactivity, and audio/video streams toweb pages), RSS (Really Simple Syndication, a familyof web feed formats used to publish frequentlyupdated content, such as blog entries or news head-lines, in a standardized format), and AJAX (Asynchro-nous Java Script, a technique to retrieve data fromweb servers asynchronously, allowing the update of\\nweb content without interfering with the display and\\nbehavior of the whole page). For the purpose of ourarticle, we consider Web 2.0 as the platform for theevolution of Social Media.\\nWhen Web 2.0 represents the ideological and\\ntechnological foundation, User Generated Content(UGC) can be seen as the sum of all ways in whichpeople make use of Social Media. The term, which\\nachieved broad popularity in 2005, is usually applied\\nto describe the various forms of media content thatare publicly available and created by end-users.According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD, 2007 ), UGC\\nneeds to fulﬁll three basic requirements in orderto be considered as such: ﬁrst, it needs to bepublished either on a publicly accessible website\\nor on a social networking site accessible to a select-\\ned group of people; second, it needs to show acertain amount of creative effort; and ﬁnally, itneeds to have been created outside of professionalroutines and practices. The ﬁrst condition excludescontent exchanged in e-mails or instant messages;the second, mere replications of already existingcontent (e.g., posting a copy of an existing newspa-\\nper article on a personal blog without any modiﬁ-\\ncations or commenting); and the third, all contentthat has been created with a commercial marketcontext in mind. While UGC has already beenavailable prior to Web 2.0, as discussed above,the combination of technological drivers (e.g.,increased broadband availability and hardwarecapacity), economic drivers (e.g., increased avail-\\nability of tools for the creation of UGC), and\\nsocial drivers (e.g., rise of a generation of‘‘digital natives’’ and ‘‘screenagers’’: younger agegroups with substantial technical knowledge andwillingness to engage online) make UGC nowadays\\nfundamentally different from what was observed inthe early 1980s. Based on these clariﬁcations of Web2.0 and UGC, it is now straightforward to give a more\\ndetailed deﬁnition of what we mean by Social Me-\\ndia. In our view– —and as used herein– —Social Media isa group of Internet-based applications that build onthe ideological and technological foundations ofWeb 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchangeof User Generated Content.\\nWithin this general deﬁnition, there are various\\ntypes of Social Media that need to be distinguished\\nfurther .

Regarding themedia-related component of Social Media, socialpresence theory ( Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976 )\\nstates that media differ in the degree of ‘‘social\\npresence’’– —deﬁned as the acoustic, visual, and phys-\\nical contact that can be achieved– —they allow toemerge between two communication partners.Social presence is inﬂuenced by the intimacy (inter-personal vs. mediated) and immediacy (asynchronousvs. synchronous) of the medium, and can be expectedto be lower for mediated (e.g., telephone conversa-tion) than interpersonal (e.g., face-to-face discus-\\nsion) and for asynchronous (e.g., e-mail) than\\nsynchronous (e.g., live chat) communications. Thehigher the social presence, the larger the socialinﬂuence that the communication partners have oneach other’s behavior . Closely related to the idea ofsocial presence is the concept of media richness.Media richness theory ( Daft & Lengel, 1986 ) is based\\non the assumption that the goal of any communica-\\ntion is the resolution of ambiguity and the reduction\\nof uncertainty.

On the one hand, this is\\ndone with the objective of inﬂuencing others to gain\\nrewards (e.g., make a positive impression on your\\nfuture in-laws); on the other hand, it is driven by awish to create an image that is consistent with one’spersonal identity (e.g., wearing a fashionable outﬁtin order to be perceived as young and trendy). Thekey reason why people decide to create a personalwebpage is, for example, the wish to present them-selves in cyberspace ( Schau & Gilly, 2003 ). Usually,\\nsuch a presentation is done through self-disclosure;\\nthat is, the conscious or unconscious revelation ofpersonal information (e.g., thoughts, feelings,likes, dislikes) that is consistent with the imageone would like to give. Self-disclosure is a criticalstep in the development of close relationships (e.g.,during dating) but can also occur between completestrangers; for example, when speaking about per-\\nsonal problems with the person seated next to you\\non an airplane. Applied to the context of SocialMedia, we assume that a second classiﬁcation canbe made based on the degree of self-disclosure itrequires and the type of self-presentation it allows.\\nCombining both dimensions leads to a classiﬁca-\\ntion of Social Media which we have visualized inTable 1 . With respect to social presence and media\\nrichness, applications such as collaborative projects\\n(e.g., Wikipedia) and blogs score lowest, as they areoften text-based and hence only allow for a rela-tively simple exchange. On the next level are con-tent communities (e.g., YouTube) and socialnetworking sites (e.g., Facebook) which, in additionto text-based communication, enable the sharing ofpictures, videos, and other forms of media. On the\\nhighest level are virtual game and social worlds\\n(e.g., World of Warcraft, Second Life), which tryto replicate all dimensions of face-to-face interac-tions in a virtual environment. Regarding self-pre-sentation and self-disclosure, blogs usually scorehigher than collaborative projects, as the lattertend to be focused on speciﬁc content domains.In a similar spirit, social networking sites allow\\nfor more self-disclosure than content communities.Finally, virtual social worlds require a higher level ofself-disclosure than virtual game worlds, as the\\nlatter are ruled by strict guidelines that force users\\nto behave in a certain way (e.g., as warriors in animaginary fantasy land). We will now provide moredetail on each of these six different types of SocialMedia, and discuss the challenges and opportunitiesthey offer companies.\\n3. The challenges and opportunities of\\nSocial Media\\n3.1. Collaborative projects\\nCollaborative projects enable the joint and simul-\\ntaneous creation of content by many end-users andare, in this sense, probably the most democratic\\nmanifestation of UGC. Within collaborative proj-\\nects, one differentiates between wikis– —that is,websites which allow users to add, remove, andchange text-based content– —and social bookmark-ing applications– —which enable the group-based col-lection and rating of Internet links or media content.Exemplary applications within this category includethe online encyclopedia Wikipedia, a wiki currently\\navailable in more than 230 different languages, and\\nthe social bookmarking web service Delicious, whichallows the storage and sharing of web bookmarks.The main idea underlying collaborative projects isthat the joint effort of many actors leads to a betteroutcome than any actor could achieve individually;this is similar to the efﬁcient-market hypothesis inbehavioral ﬁnance ( Fama, 1970 ). From a corporate\\nperspective, ﬁrms must be aware that collaborative\\nprojects are trending toward becoming the mainsource of information for many consumers. As such,although not everything written on Wikipedia mayactually be true, it is believed to be true by more\\nand more Internet users. This may be particularlycrucial as regards corporate crises.

Finnish handset manufac-turer Nokia, for instance, uses internal wikis toupdate employees on project status and to tradeideas, which are used by about 20% of its 68,000staff members. Likewise, American computer soft-ware company Adobe Systems maintains a list ofbookmarks to company-related websites and con-\\nversations on Delicious.\\n3.2. Blogs\\nBlogs, which represent the earliest form of Social\\nMedia, are special types of websites that usuallydisplay date-stamped entries in reverse chronologi-cal order ( OECD, 2007 ). They are the Social Media\\nequivalent of personal web pages and can come in a\\nmultitude of different variations, from personaldiaries describing the author’s life to summariesof all relevant information in one speciﬁc contentarea. Blogs are usually managed by one person only,but provide the possibility of interaction with othersthrough the addition of comments. Due to theirhistorical roots, text-based blogs are still by far\\nthe most common. Nevertheless, blogs have also\\nbegun to take different media formats. For exam-ple, San Francisco-based Justin.tv allows users tocreate personalized television channels via whichthey can broadcast images from their webcam inreal time to other users. Many companies are al-ready using blogs to update employees, customers,and shareholders on developments they consider to\\nbe important. Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Micro-\\nsystems, maintains a personal blog to improve thetransparency of his company; so does automotivegiant General Motors. Yet, as is the case with col-laborative projects, blogs do not come withoutrisks. These generally present in two fashions. First,customers who– —for one reason or another– —turnout to be dissatisﬁed with or disappointed by the\\ncompany’s offerings may decide to engage in virtual\\ncomplaints in the form of protest websites or blogs(Ward & Ostrom, 2006 ), which results in the avail-\\nability of potentially damaging information in onlinespace. Second, once ﬁrms encourage employees tobe active on blogs, they may need to live with theconsequences of staff members writing negativelyabout the ﬁrm. Microsoft’s former ‘‘technical evan-\\ngelist’’ Robert Scoble, for example, had a tendency\\nto ﬁercely criticize the products of his employer– —before he decided to leave the Redmond-basedsoftware company in 2006.3.3. Content communities\\nThe main objective of content communities is thesharing of media content between users. Content\\ncommunities exist for a wide range of different\\nmedia types, including text (e.g., BookCrossing,via which 750,000+ people from over 130countries share books), photos (e.g., Flickr), videos(e.g., YouTube), and PowerPoint presentations(e.g., Slideshare). Users on content communitiesare not required to create a personal proﬁle page;if they do, these pages usually only contain basic\\ninformation, such as the date they joined the com-\\nmunity and the number of videos shared. From acorporate viewpoint, content communities carrythe risk of being used as platforms for the sharingof copyright-protected materials. While major con-tent communities have rules in place to ban andremove such illegal content, it is difﬁcult to avoidpopular videos– —such as recent episodes of comedy\\ndramas– —being uploaded to YouTube only hours after\\nthey have been aired on television. On the positiveside, the high popularity of content communitiesmakes them a very attractive contact channel formany ﬁrms; this is easy to believe when one con-siders that YouTube serves over 100 million videosper day.

Virtual game worlds\\nVirtual worlds are platforms that replicate a three-dimensional environment in which users can appearin the form of personalized avatars and interact witheach other as they would in real life. In this sense,virtual worlds are probably the ultimate manifesta-tion of Social Media, as they provide the highestlevel of social presence and media richness of allapplications discussed thus far. Virtual worlds come\\nin two forms. The ﬁrst, virtual game worlds, require\\ntheir users to behave according to strict rules in thecontext of a massively multiplayer online role-play-ing game (MMORPG). These applications have gainedpopularity in recent years, as standard game con-soles– —such as Microsoft’s X-Box and Sony’s Play-Station– —now allow simultaneous play among amultitude of users around the globe. Examples of\\nvirtual game worlds include the cod-medieval\\n‘‘World of Warcraft,’’ which counts around 8.5 mil-lion subscribers who explore the virtual planet ofAzeroth in the form of humans, dwarves, orcs, ornight elves, to ﬁght monsters or to search for trea-sure; and Sony’s EverQuest, in which 16 differentraces of players (e.g., wizards, clerics) travel thefantasy world of Norrath. The rules of such games\\nusually limit the degree of self-presentation and\\nself-disclosure possible, although some users spendso much time with these applications that theircharacter– —be it a warrior , a wizard, or a dragonhunter– —starts to more and more closely resemble\\ntheir real life personality. Besides their use for in-game advertising (similar in idea to productplacement in blockbuster movies), the high popu-\\nlarity of virtual game worlds can also be leveraged\\nin more traditional communication campaigns.Japanese automotive giant Toyota, for example,used pictures and mechanics from the World ofWarcraft application in its latest Tundra commercialto reach the 2.5 million players in the U.S. alone.\\n3.6. Virtual social worlds\\nThe second group of virtual worlds, often referred toas virtual social worlds, allows inhabitants to choosetheir behavior more freely and essentially live avirtual life similar to their real life.

Next, we provide such a set of recom-\\nmendations. Given that Social Media have both asocial- and a media-component, we split our adviceinto two sections: ﬁve points about using media andﬁve points about being social.\\n4.1. Five points about using media\\n4.1.1. Choose carefullyThere are dozens– —if not hundreds– —of Social Mediaapplications, and new ones are appearing on thehorizon every day. If you still need time to run yourcore business, you simply cannot participate in themall, especially since ‘‘being active’’ is one key re-quirement of success (see below). Choosing theright medium for any given purpose depends on\\nthe target group to be reached and the message\\nto be communicated. On the one hand, each SocialMedia application usually attracts a certain group ofpeople and ﬁrms should be active wherever theircustomers are present. For example, if your maintarget audience is book lovers, a content communityvia which users share self-written novels or poems islikely better suited to your purpose than a virtual\\nworld which centers on ﬁghting dragons and ﬁnding\\ntreasures. On the other hand, there may be situa-tions whereby certain features are necessary toensure effective communication, and these featuresare only offered by one speciﬁc application. Forexample, when the U.S. Army undertook an initia-tive in 2007 to reach the Hispanic community,it decided to utilize the social networking site\\nUnivision rather than the more popular Facebook.\\nThis choice was driven in part by the fact thatUnivision– —a Spanish-language television networkin the U.S. and Puerto Rico– —is the social networkingapplication with the largest Latin American audi-ence, due to an extensive range of telenovelas andMexican programs produced by Grupo Televisa.However, another reason Univision was chosen is\\nbecause it offers a moderating service which checks\\ncomments from users for appropriateness beforeposting them on the site. In contrast, other appli-cations, including Facebook, allow users to postmessages without supervision.\\n4.1.2. Pick the application, or make your own\\nOnce you know which game you’re playing, the next\\ndecision involves whether to make or buy. In some\\ncases, it might just be best to join an existing SocialMedia application and beneﬁt from its popularityand user base. After all, there is no need to reinventthe wheel if somebody has already done it, espe-\\ncially given that Social Media show positive networkexternalities in the sense that they get more attrac-tive to join the more participants they already have.\\nBut in some cases, the right application might just\\nnot be available yet. Japan’s Fujiﬁlm, for example,recently launched its own social network to build acommunity of photo enthusiasts. In a similar spirit,U.S.-based department store ﬁrm Sears collaborat-ed with MTV music television to create a socialnetwork around back-to-school shopping. Yet, what-ever the ultimate decision– —to buy, make, or both– —\\nit is vital that there is an understanding of the basic\\nidea behind Social Media. It’s all about participa-tion, sharing, and collaboration, rather thanstraightforward advertising and selling.\\n4.1.3. Ensure activity alignment\\nSometimes you may decide to rely on various SocialMedia, or a set of different applications within the\\nsame group, in order to have the largest possible\\nreach. In this case, it is crucial to ensure that yourSocial Media activities are all aligned with eachother. A prime example in this context is computermanufacturer Dell and its ‘‘Digital Nomads’’ cam-paign. Dell uses a combination of social networkingsites (Facebook, LinkedIn), blogs, and content com-munities (YouTube videos) to show how its range of\\nlaptop computers enable individuals to become a\\nnomadic mobile workforce. In a similar spirit, Chrys-ler’s Jeep brand connects with its customers bycombining photos shared on the content communityFlickr, with groups on social networking sites such asMySpace and Facebook. Using different contactchannels can be a worthwhile and proﬁtable strate-gy. But remember: one goal of communication is the\\nresolution of ambiguity and reduction of uncertain-\\nty, and nothing is more confusing than contradictingmessages across different channels.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4426, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='71d8d307-0cce-498e-813c-f9f762b579fb', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '65', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ee97416b-939a-4bfa-82da-d2d3e1e8f573', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '65', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='29d778d93104b787d24189af5132ed3b0a28f7840fc9803169f0f0a3503f8bdb'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='88a7413c-5482-4521-94dc-8e885f29ff74', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '65', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='6c60ad8b3be8e6594531fc00e801ae5d065f3f1f4f318998fbcb06b4e75d8b67'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='1f2b0bea-a653-40f1-84d1-d8829a559b11', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='489073d6732e4983cfaeb752c9cbead271595dc6c9523206562d4907d89fe450')}, text='In this case, it is crucial to ensure that yourSocial Media activities are all aligned with eachother.

Media plan integration\\nWhat is true for different types of Social Media alsoholds for the relationship between Social Media andtraditional media: Integration is key! While you may\\nconsider these two arenas to be completely differ-\\nent, in customers’ eyes they are both part of thesame: your corporate image. Consider the actions ofsoft drink giant Coca-Cola. In June 2006, a pair ofperformance artists shot a video featuring a series ofgeysers they created by dropping Mentos brandmints into 2-liter bottles of Coke; the clip becamea major hit on YouTube. Realizing customers’ enthu-\\nsiasm for this performance, Coca-Cola fostered the\\nsensation by airing the video on late-night televisionand ensuring broad digital distribution across differ-ent content communities.

Access for all\\nAlthough this might sound elementary, once the ﬁrm\\nhas decided to utilize Social Media applications, it isworth checking that all employees may actuallyaccess them. Commonly, ﬁrms block Facebook,YouTube, and Second Life on corporate PCs for fearthat staff might spend too much time networkinginstead of working. While this is certainly a consid-eration, it cannot imply that employees must have\\nspecial permission to be able to access the company\\nblog. At the same time, there is a need to curtail thepossibility of the entire organization spending all itstime producing funny videos and uploading them toYouTube. One possible approach involves deﬁninggroups of employees whose primary objective is themanagement of corporate Social Media; all otherstaff members are treated as occasional partici-\\npants. Under this scenario, the ﬁrst group is given\\nadministrator rights– —which allows the opening ofnew discussion threads and deletion of inappropri-ate posts– —while the second group is not. Also, atsome point, it will be necessary to develop certainguidelines for Social Media usage; as done, forinstance, by ‘‘Big Blue’’ IBM, which has a corporatecharta for appropriate behavior within Second Life.\\nFor example, it is important to highlight that every\\nemployee needs to identify himself or herself assuch when posting a comment on the corporateblog. Otherwise, end-consumers could get theimpression that anonymous accounts are used toenable employees to post fake messages and over-ly-positive feedback, which could severely damagethe credibility of your whole Social Media campaign.\\n4.2. Five points about being social\\n4.2.1. Be activeIf you want to develop a relationship with someone,it is always advisable to take the lead and to beactive. Social Media are all about sharing and inter-action, so ensure that your content is always fresh\\nand that you engage in discussions with your cus-\\ntomers. Consider the aforementioned blog kept bySun Microsystems CEO Jonathan Schwartz. Via thisoutlet, the ﬁgurehead discusses– —on an ongoingbasis– —his corporate strategy, new product develop-ment projects, and company values, and repliesdirectly to correspondence received. In consideringyour Social Media efforts, be aware that ﬁrm in-\\nvolvement must extend beyond responding to neg-\\native comments and defending product offerings.Social Media is less about explaining why your bakingmix, detergent, or shampoo is better than anyoneelse’s than it is about engaging others in open and\\nactive conversation. Participants on Social Mediaapplications have the desire to actively engageand to become both producers and consumers of\\ninformation, so-called ‘‘prosumers’’ ( Tofﬂer , 1980 ).\\nBe considerate of this need and act accordingly.\\n4.2.2. Be interesting\\nLet’s face it: nobody is interested in speaking to aboring person. As such, if you would like your cus-tomers to engage with you, you need to give them areason for doing so– —one which extends beyond\\nsaying you are the best airline in town, or manufac-\\nture the most robust kitchen blender. The ﬁrst stepis to listen to your customers. Find out what they\\nwould like to hear; what they would like to talk\\nabout; what they might ﬁnd interesting, enjoyable,\\nand valuable. Then, develop and post content thatﬁts those expectations. Coffee powerhouse Star-bucks, for example, created the ‘‘My Starbucks\\nIdea’’ platform, via which customers can submit\\nnew ideas for the company. These ideas are subse-quently voted on by other users, with the winnersbeing considered for implementation by Starbuckstop management. As stated by Oscar Wilde in hisnovel, The Picture of Dorian Grey : The one sin for\\nwhich there is no forgiveness is ennui.\\n4.2.3. Be humble\\nNever forget that Social Media existed before youdecided to engage in them; indeed, in many cases,even before you knew about their existence.

Yet, interaction and feedback are criticalelements of all Social Media, blogs included. Hence,\\nmany readers perceived the Boeing blog as a fake,\\nand simply corporate advertising in disguise. If thereis one certain path to failure, it involves thinkingthat Social Media is just about posting existing TVspots on YouTube or putting prefabricated pressannouncements on corporate blogs.\\n4.2.4.

There’s no need to spend $100,000 todesign the perfect MySpace presence, or hire aprofessional writer to manage your corporate blog.\\nInstead, try to blend in with other users and don’t be\\nafraid to make mistakes! Bill Marriott, Chairman andCEO of the Marriott International Hotel chain, useshis blog, for example, to post regular updates andstories from his travels to Marriott properties aroundthe world– —very much in the same way as would awork colleague when describing her last vacation.Social Media users are people like you, who under-\\nstand that things do not always go smoothly. And, if\\nyou’re nice to them, they may even give you freeadvice on how to do it better the next time.\\n4.2.5. Be honest\\nLast but not least, be honest and respect the rules ofthe game. Some Social Media– —such as Wikipedia– —may not allow companies to be involved, so do not\\ntry to force your way in. Consider Anheuser-Busch,\\nowner of SeaWorld marine mammal parks. Anheus-er-Busch tried to ‘‘rectify’’ misleading informationon Wikipedia through the use of PR ﬁrms, and failedmiserably at it. Never expect that other participantsmay not ﬁnd out who stands behind some anonymoususer account; after all, you’re dealing with some ofthe most technologically sophisticated people on\\nthe planet.\\n5. Nothing to lose but their chains\\nToday, everything is about Social Media. Some in-\\ndustry gurus claim that if you do not participate inFacebook, YouTube, and Second Life, you are not\\npart of cyberspace anymore. Social Media allow\\nﬁrms to engage in timely and direct end-consumercontact at relatively low cost and higher levels ofefﬁciency than can be achieved with more tradi-tional communication tools. This makes Social Medianot only relevant for large multinational ﬁrms, butalso for small and medium sized companies, andeven nonproﬁt and governmental agencies. Using\\nSocial Media is not an easy task and may require new\\nways of thinking, but the potential gains are far frombeing negligible. Dell, for example, states that itsuse of T witter– —a micro blogging application thatallows sending out short, text-based posts of 140characters or less– —has generated $1 million in in-cremental revenue due to sales alerts. Some ﬁrmsmay even be too successful for their own good, as\\nillustrated by Burger King’s ‘‘Whopper Sacriﬁce’’\\ncampaign: In December 2008, the fast food giantdeveloped a Facebook application which gave usersa free Whopper sandwich for every 10 friends theydeleted from their Facebook network. The cam-\\npaign was adopted by over 20,000 users, resultingin the sacriﬁcing of 233,906 friends in exchange forfree burgers. Only one month later , in January 2009,\\nFacebook shut down Whopper Sacriﬁce, citing pri-\\nvacy concerns. Who would have thought that theprice of a friendship is less than $2 a dozen?\\nA new trend is on the horizon, though; Watch out\\nfor Mobile Social Media! Mobile Web 2.0 is very similarto Web 2.0, as discussed earlier. In contrast to itspredecessor Mobile Web 1.0, which relied on propri-etary protocols (e.g., WAP) and use-based pricing,\\nMobile Web 2.0 is characterized by open standards\\n(e.g., a transition to the TCP/IP protocol, the tech-nical foundation of the World Wide Web) and ﬂat-ratesystems. Even the manual entry of web addressesusing small and difﬁcult-to-handle keyboards isbecoming history. Soon, all items around you willbe equipped with Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation(RFID) tags that will be able to automatically connect\\nto your mobile phone and send URLs to them, similar\\nto today’s text messages. This technical evolution islaying the groundwork for moving Social Media ap-plications away from desktop PCs and laptops, to-ward mobile devices. Why log into Facebook if youcan easily update all your friends using T witter? Whywait until you return home to watch the new YouT ubevideo if you can do so conveniently on your iPhone?\\nAccording to Jupiter Research, the market for\\nMobile Web 2.0 evolutions will grow from a mere$5.5 billion today to an impressive $22.4 billion by2013.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4074, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='a958e0e1-d3e8-49b4-aaa6-0a7bc4f901fb', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '67', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='85ae0918-6c1c-4f51-952b-8842346b7c64', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '67', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='a12094ffbb58162d241e5d5aa350123ea6286127e4d8493d49ebdd884a1cc92b'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='86102f4e-f5f9-4f86-a41e-7e5c12e8cb88', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '67', 'file_name': '1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1-s2.0-S0007681309001232-main.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 182136, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='4891c30bb6c4e60fd04697c4ec3fafc79b7b9f45d9a18e3bb2ba649e713df5eb'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='59d4e0bd-a9e3-402a-8b84-290d43feaa23', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='56252c7dde0409ae9d781d2a4278074a4cf2e8353852d3b07aeb8295cf8738c5')}, text='Even the manual entry of web addressesusing small and difﬁcult-to-handle keyboards isbecoming history.

Mobile Social Media applications are expectedto be the main driver of this evolution, soon ac-counting for over 50% of the market. In one way, thissurge toward Mobile Social Media can even be seenas another step toward Internet democratization\\nand closing the digital divide between developed\\nand emerging countries. In India, for example, mo-bile phones outnumber PCs by 10 to 1. In Thailand,only 13% of the population owns a computer , versus82% who have access to a mobile phone. It is there-fore not surprising that the Pew Research Center– —aWashington-based think tank– —estimates that by2020, a mobile device will be the primary Internet\\nconnection tool for most people in the world. Making\\nSocial Media applications mobile is likely to tap acurrently unexploited base of new users. Even if per-capita spending in these countries may still be low,vast population numbers make them relevant forvirtually any ﬁrm.\\nObviously, Mobile Social Media does not come\\nwithout a price.

Some recent epidemiological data seem to support the view that many\\nsegments of the adult population have chronically inadequate sleep. On the otherhand, some experts have claimed that our core, basic amount of sleep is around 6 hper night, and that the rest of our sleep can be easily curtailed, being unnecessaryto fulﬁll any sleep need. However, experimental data on the effects of both acuteand cumulative partial sleep deprivation (PSD) consistently point out that sleeprestriction has substantial negative effects on sleepiness, motor and cognitive per-formance and mood, as well as on some metabolic, hormonal and immunologicalvariables. As chronic PSD may have serious long-term adverse health effects, it shouldbe avoided in the general population. In the short-term, the effects of sleep curtailmentseem to accumulate linearly, while the effects of long-term PSD should be furtherinvestigated, as the few available studies are ﬂawed by methodological weaknesses.On the other hand, there is evidence that extending sleep by 2–3 h beyond the normproduces only marginal beneﬁts for an average individual. Finally, it is underlined that,as large individual differences do exist in the need for sleep, the search for thesleep\\nneed may be vain.

Unlike recent language repre-\\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-\\ntuned with just one additional output layer\\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\\nspeciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations.\\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\\npowerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art re-\\nsults on eleven natural language processing\\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\\n1 Introduction\\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\\nbe effective for improving many natural language\\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\\nwhere models are required to produce ﬁne-grained\\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).There are two existing strategies for apply-\\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\\nstream tasks: feature-based andﬁne-tuning . The\\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\\net al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that\\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\\ntional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as\\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\\ntask-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the\\ndownstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning allpre-\\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\\ngeneral language representations.\\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\\ncially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-\\njor limitation is that standard language models are\\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\\nand could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-\\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\\nporate context from both directions.\\nIn this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based\\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\\nEncoder Representations from Transformers.\\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\\nrectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-\\nguage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\\npredict the original vocabulary id of the maskedarXiv:1810.04805v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2019', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3953, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='4047e09d-22c2-4b2b-9481-dce5308a5804', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3b3273a5-b32f-487f-82f2-8048919e1f94', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='5d12857b129c85632750555cc1b1fc69f963036da9bf1214e6c359af4348e2d9'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='370fb30a-4f31-45ab-b349-efdafcf36b66', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='c6fc312537c39fd86a2c57c38eaad4d0223552aebac974b4203b3768e6913ebd'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5451dcf1-5aad-4083-8387-771f5a1fe435', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='81658603376cc3f2e0565366cd373e0750062474ec5b24447a25185be62b565e')}, text='word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer. In addi-\\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\\na “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-\\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\\nof our paper are as follows:\\n• We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\\npre-training for language representations. Un-\\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\\n• We show that pre-trained representations reduce\\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\\nspeciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-\\ntuning based representation model that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\\nof sentence-level andtoken-level tasks, outper-\\nforming many task-speciﬁc architectures.\\n• BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\\nNLP tasks.

Pre-trained word embeddings\\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\\nfering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings\\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).These approaches have been generalized to\\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\\ntence words given a representation of the previous\\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\\nwith existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo\\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\\ndict a single word from both left and right context\\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\\nels.\\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the ﬁrst\\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text (Col-\\nlobert and Weston, 2008).', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3962, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='5451dcf1-5aad-4083-8387-771f5a1fe435', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3b3273a5-b32f-487f-82f2-8048919e1f94', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='5d12857b129c85632750555cc1b1fc69f963036da9bf1214e6c359af4348e2d9'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='4047e09d-22c2-4b2b-9481-dce5308a5804', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': '1810.04805.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/1810.04805.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 775166, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='482622ec79d17c483a08de32c1f6cd337b0c797182a780e90aa2c5f8044868dc'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='b8243491-d3f3-4bcc-8aa5-26c20c7e77d0', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='cc2be208ebfd50eee2ca6aea7f7106cae4bea61f55ba60eef4b1427811ffa7b4')}, text='Melamud et al.

There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning . Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\neters are ﬁne-tuned using labeled data from the\\ndownstream tasks. Each downstream task has sep-\\narate ﬁne-tuned models, even though they are ini-\\ntialized with the same pre-trained parameters. The\\nquestion-answering example in Figure 1 will serve\\nas a running example for this section.\\nA distinctive feature of BERT is its uniﬁed ar-\\nchitecture across different tasks. There is mini-mal difference between the pre-trained architec-\\nture and the ﬁnal downstream architecture.\\nModel Architecture BERT’s model architec-\\nture is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer en-\\ncoder based on the original implementation de-\\nscribed in Vaswani et al.

A “sequence” refers to the in-\\nput token sequence to BERT, which may be a sin-\\ngle sentence or two sentences packed together.\\nWe use WordPiece embeddings (Wu et al.,\\n2016) with a 30,000 token vocabulary. The ﬁrst\\ntoken of every sequence is always a special clas-\\nsiﬁcation token ( [CLS] ). The ﬁnal hidden state\\ncorresponding to this token is used as the ag-\\ngregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation\\ntasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a\\nsingle sequence. We differentiate the sentences in\\ntwo ways. First, we separate them with a special\\ntoken ( [SEP] ). Second, we add a learned embed-\\nding to every token indicating whether it belongs\\nto sentence Aor sentence B. As shown in Figure 1,\\nwe denote input embedding as E, the ﬁnal hidden\\nvector of the special [CLS] token asC∈RH,\\nand the ﬁnal hidden vector for the ithinput token\\nasTi∈RH.\\nFor a given token, its input representation is\\nconstructed by summing the corresponding token,\\nsegment, and position embeddings. A visualiza-\\ntion of this construction can be seen in Figure 2.\\n3.1 Pre-training BERT\\nUnlike Peters et al. (2018a) and Radford et al.\\n(2018), we do not use traditional left-to-right or\\nright-to-left language models to pre-train BERT.\\nInstead, we pre-train BERT using two unsuper-\\nvised tasks, described in this section. This step\\nis presented in the left part of Figure 1.\\nTask #1: Masked LM Intuitively, it is reason-\\nable to believe that a deep bidirectional model is\\nstrictly more powerful than either a left-to-right\\nmodel or the shallow concatenation of a left-to-\\nright and a right-to-left model. Unfortunately,\\nstandard conditional language models can only be\\ntrained left-to-right orright-to-left, since bidirec-\\ntional conditioning would allow each word to in-\\ndirectly “see itself”, and the model could trivially\\npredict the target word in a multi-layered context.\\nformer is often referred to as a “Transformer encoder” while\\nthe left-context-only version is referred to as a “Transformer\\ndecoder” since it can be used for text generation.In order to train a deep bidirectional representa-\\ntion, we simply mask some percentage of the input\\ntokens at random, and then predict those masked\\ntokens. We refer to this procedure as a “masked\\nLM” (MLM), although it is often referred to as a\\nCloze task in the literature (Taylor, 1953). In this\\ncase, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the\\nmask tokens are fed into an output softmax over\\nthe vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our\\nexperiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-\\nkens in each sequence at random. In contrast to\\ndenoising auto-encoders (Vincent et al., 2008), we\\nonly predict the masked words rather than recon-\\nstructing the entire input.\\nAlthough this allows us to obtain a bidirec-\\ntional pre-trained model, a downside is that we\\nare creating a mismatch between pre-training and\\nﬁne-tuning, since the [MASK] token does not ap-\\npear during ﬁne-tuning. To mitigate this, we do\\nnot always replace “masked” words with the ac-\\ntual[MASK] token. The training data generator\\nchooses 15% of the token positions at random for\\nprediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace\\nthei-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time.

The input embeddings are the sum of the token embeddings, the segmenta-\\ntion embeddings and the position embeddings.\\nThe NSP task is closely related to representation-\\nlearning objectives used in Jernite et al. (2017) and\\nLogeswaran and Lee (2018). However, in prior\\nwork, only sentence embeddings are transferred to\\ndown-stream tasks, where BERT transfers all pa-\\nrameters to initialize end-task model parameters.\\nPre-training data The pre-training procedure\\nlargely follows the existing literature on language\\nmodel pre-training. For the pre-training corpus we\\nuse the BooksCorpus (800M words) (Zhu et al.,\\n2015) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words).\\nFor Wikipedia we extract only the text passages\\nand ignore lists, tables, and headers. It is criti-\\ncal to use a document-level corpus rather than a\\nshufﬂed sentence-level corpus such as the Billion\\nWord Benchmark (Chelba et al., 2013) in order to\\nextract long contiguous sequences.\\n3.2 Fine-tuning BERT\\nFine-tuning is straightforward since the self-\\nattention mechanism in the Transformer al-\\nlows BERT to model many downstream tasks—\\nwhether they involve single text or text pairs—by\\nswapping out the appropriate inputs and outputs.\\nFor applications involving text pairs, a common\\npattern is to independently encode text pairs be-\\nfore applying bidirectional cross attention, such\\nas Parikh et al. (2016); Seo et al. (2017). BERT\\ninstead uses the self-attention mechanism to unify\\nthese two stages, as encoding a concatenated text\\npair with self-attention effectively includes bidi-\\nrectional cross attention between two sentences.\\nFor each task, we simply plug in the task-\\nspeciﬁc inputs and outputs into BERT and ﬁne-\\ntune all the parameters end-to-end. At the in-\\nput, sentence Aand sentence Bfrom pre-training\\nare analogous to (1) sentence pairs in paraphras-\\ning, (2) hypothesis-premise pairs in entailment, (3)\\nquestion-passage pairs in question answering, and(4) a degenerate text- ∅pair in text classiﬁcation\\nor sequence tagging. At the output, the token rep-\\nresentations are fed into an output layer for token-\\nlevel tasks, such as sequence tagging or question\\nanswering, and the [CLS] representation is fed\\ninto an output layer for classiﬁcation, such as en-\\ntailment or sentiment analysis.\\nCompared to pre-training, ﬁne-tuning is rela-\\ntively inexpensive. All of the results in the pa-\\nper can be replicated in at most 1 hour on a sin-\\ngle Cloud TPU, or a few hours on a GPU, starting\\nfrom the exact same pre-trained model.7We de-\\nscribe the task-speciﬁc details in the correspond-\\ning subsections of Section 4. More details can be\\nfound in Appendix A.5.\\n4 Experiments\\nIn this section, we present BERT ﬁne-tuning re-\\nsults on 11 NLP tasks.\\n4.1 GLUE\\nThe General Language Understanding Evaluation\\n(GLUE) benchmark (Wang et al., 2018a) is a col-\\nlection of diverse natural language understanding\\ntasks.

The left-only constraint\\nwas also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing\\nit introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that\\ndegraded downstream performance. Additionally,\\nthis model was pre-trained without the NSP task.\\nThis is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but\\nusing our larger training dataset, our input repre-\\nsentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme.\\nWe ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP\\ntask. In Table 5, we show that removing NSP\\nhurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,\\nand SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact\\nof training bidirectional representations by com-\\nparing “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”. The LTR\\nmodel performs worse than the MLM model on all\\ntasks, with large drops on MRPC and SQuAD.\\nFor SQuAD it is intuitively clear that a LTR\\nmodel will perform poorly at token predictions,\\nsince the token-level hidden states have no right-\\nside context. In order to make a good faith at-\\ntempt at strengthening the LTR system, we added\\na randomly initialized BiLSTM on top. This does\\nsigniﬁcantly improve results on SQuAD, but theresults are still far worse than those of the pre-\\ntrained bidirectional models. The BiLSTM hurts\\nperformance on the GLUE tasks.\\nWe recognize that it would also be possible to\\ntrain separate LTR and RTL models and represent\\neach token as the concatenation of the two mod-\\nels, as ELMo does. However: (a) this is twice as\\nexpensive as a single bidirectional model; (b) this\\nis non-intuitive for tasks like QA, since the RTL\\nmodel would not be able to condition the answer\\non the question; (c) this it is strictly less powerful\\nthan a deep bidirectional model, since it can use\\nboth left and right context at every layer.\\n5.2 Effect of Model Size\\nIn this section, we explore the effect of model size\\non ﬁne-tuning task accuracy.

The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the Bembed-\\nding. 50% of the time Bis the actual next sentence\\nthat follows Aand 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-\\nbined length is≤512 tokens. The LM masking is\\napplied after WordPiece tokenization with a uni-\\nform masking rate of 15%, and no special consid-\\neration given to partial word pieces.\\nWe train with batch size of 256 sequences (256\\nsequences * 512 tokens = 128,000 tokens/batch)\\nfor 1,000,000 steps, which is approximately 40epochs over the 3.3 billion word corpus. We\\nuse Adam with learning rate of 1e-4, β1= 0.9,\\nβ2= 0.999, L2 weight decay of 0.01, learning\\nrate warmup over the ﬁrst 10,000 steps, and linear\\ndecay of the learning rate. We use a dropout prob-\\nability of 0.1 on all layers. We use a gelu acti-\\nvation (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) rather than\\nthe standard relu , following OpenAI GPT. The\\ntraining loss is the sum of the mean masked LM\\nlikelihood and the mean next sentence prediction\\nlikelihood.\\nTraining of BERT BASE was performed on 4\\nCloud TPUs in Pod conﬁguration (16 TPU chips\\ntotal).13Training of BERT LARGE was performed\\non 16 Cloud TPUs (64 TPU chips total). Each pre-\\ntraining took 4 days to complete.\\nLonger sequences are disproportionately expen-\\nsive because attention is quadratic to the sequence\\nlength. To speed up pretraing in our experiments,\\nwe pre-train the model with sequence length of\\n128 for 90% of the steps. Then, we train the rest\\n10% of the steps of sequence of 512 to learn the\\npositional embeddings.\\nA.3 Fine-tuning Procedure\\nFor ﬁne-tuning, most model hyperparameters are\\nthe same as in pre-training, with the exception of\\nthe batch size, learning rate, and number of train-\\ning epochs.

The comparisons be-\\ntween the model architectures are shown visually\\nin Figure 3. Note that in addition to the architec-\\nture differences, BERT and OpenAI GPT are ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches, while ELMo is a feature-based\\napproach.\\nThe most comparable existing pre-training\\nmethod to BERT is OpenAI GPT, which trains a\\nleft-to-right Transformer LM on a large text cor-\\npus. In fact, many of the design decisions in BERT\\nwere intentionally made to make it as close to\\nGPT as possible so that the two methods could be\\nminimally compared. The core argument of this\\nwork is that the bi-directionality and the two pre-\\ntraining tasks presented in Section 3.1 account for\\nthe majority of the empirical improvements, but\\nwe do note that there are several other differences\\nbetween how BERT and GPT were trained:\\n• GPT is trained on the BooksCorpus (800M\\nwords); BERT is trained on the BooksCor-\\npus (800M words) and Wikipedia (2,500M\\nwords).\\n• GPT uses a sentence separator ( [SEP] ) and\\nclassiﬁer token ( [CLS] ) which are only in-\\ntroduced at ﬁne-tuning time; BERT learns\\n[SEP] ,[CLS] and sentence A/Bembed-\\ndings during pre-training.\\n• GPT was trained for 1M steps with a batch\\nsize of 32,000 words; BERT was trained for\\n1M steps with a batch size of 128,000 words.\\n• GPT used the same learning rate of 5e-5 for\\nall ﬁne-tuning experiments; BERT chooses a\\ntask-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning learning rate which\\nperforms the best on the development set.To isolate the effect of these differences, we per-\\nform ablation experiments in Section 5.1 which\\ndemonstrate that the majority of the improvements\\nare in fact coming from the two pre-training tasks\\nand the bidirectionality they enable.\\nA.5 Illustrations of Fine-tuning on Different\\nTasks\\nThe illustration of ﬁne-tuning BERT on different\\ntasks can be seen in Figure 4. Our task-speciﬁc\\nmodels are formed by incorporating BERT with\\none additional output layer, so a minimal num-\\nber of parameters need to be learned from scratch.\\nAmong the tasks, (a) and (b) are sequence-level\\ntasks while (c) and (d) are token-level tasks.

This allows us to answer the following\\nquestions:\\n1. Question: Does BERT really need such\\na large amount of pre-training (128,000\\nwords/batch * 1,000,000 steps) to achieve\\nhigh ﬁne-tuning accuracy?\\nAnswer: Yes, BERT BASE achieves almost\\n1.0% additional accuracy on MNLI when\\ntrained on 1M steps compared to 500k steps.\\n2. Question: Does MLM pre-training converge\\nslower than LTR pre-training, since only 15%\\nof words are predicted in each batch rather\\nthan every word?\\nAnswer: The MLM model does converge\\nslightly slower than the LTR model. How-\\never, in terms of absolute accuracy the MLM\\nmodel begins to outperform the LTR model\\nalmost immediately.\\nC.2 Ablation for Different Masking\\nProcedures\\nIn Section 3.1, we mention that BERT uses a\\nmixed strategy for masking the target tokens when\\npre-training with the masked language model\\n(MLM) objective. The following is an ablation\\nstudy to evaluate the effect of different masking\\nstrategies.\\n200 400 600 800 1,0007678808284\\nPre-training Steps (Thousands)MNLI Dev Accuracy\\nBERT BASE (Masked LM)\\nBERT BASE (Left-to-Right)\\nFigure 5: Ablation over number of training steps. This\\nshows the MNLI accuracy after ﬁne-tuning, starting\\nfrom model parameters that have been pre-trained for\\nksteps. The x-axis is the value of k.Note that the purpose of the masking strategies\\nis to reduce the mismatch between pre-training\\nand ﬁne-tuning, as the [MASK] symbol never ap-\\npears during the ﬁne-tuning stage. We report the\\nDev results for both MNLI and NER. For NER,\\nwe report both ﬁne-tuning and feature-based ap-\\nproaches, as we expect the mismatch will be am-\\npliﬁed for the feature-based approach as the model\\nwill not have the chance to adjust the representa-\\ntions.\\nMasking Rates Dev Set Results\\nMASK SAME RND MNLI NER\\nFine-tune Fine-tune Feature-based\\n80% 10% 10% 84.2 95.4 94.9\\n100% 0% 0% 84.3 94.9 94.0\\n80% 0% 20% 84.1 95.2 94.6\\n80% 20% 0% 84.4 95.2 94.7\\n0% 20% 80% 83.7 94.8 94.6\\n0% 0% 100% 83.6 94.9 94.6\\nTable 8: Ablation over different masking strategies.\\nThe results are presented in Table 8.

For the feature-based approach,\\nwe concatenate the last 4 layers of BERT as the\\nfeatures, which was shown to be the best approach\\nin Section 5.3.\\nFrom the table it can be seen that ﬁne-tuning is\\nsurprisingly robust to different masking strategies.\\nHowever, as expected, using only the M ASK strat-\\negy was problematic when applying the feature-\\nbased approach to NER.

if preconditioning the SDF-1/CXCR4 (Stromal\\n \\nCell-derived Factor 1/ Chemokine Receptor 4) axis to attract more MSCs (Mesenchymal Stem\\n \\nCells) to the site of injury in OA (Osteoarthritis) is as viable as completely blockading the axis.\\n \\nFor this reason, a systematic review of existing research allowed for a grounded theory method\\n \\nto be employed. The reviewed studies were separated into 3 groups. The blockade group\\n \\ndisplayed the use of T140 and AMD3100 as the primary inhibitors of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.\\n \\nThe control group displayed the effects of unaided MSC homing in OA, serving as a bridge\\n \\nbetween the two extremes of the field.

Gathercole\\nCentre for the Study of Memory and Learning, University of Bristol, U.K.\\nThis article reviews recent advances in understanding the changes in memory function that\\ntake place during the childhood years. Development of the following aspects of memory areconsidered: short-term memory, comprising phonological memory, visuospatial memory,and executive function; autobiographical memory; episodic memory, including eyewitnessmemory; and metamemory. Each of these aspects of memory function shows substantialqualitative change from infancy, through the preschool period, to the early school years.Beyond about 7 years of age, however, memory function appears adult-like in organisationand strategies, and shows only a gradual quantitative improvement through to earlyadolescence.\\nKeywords: Memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, autobiographical memory,\\nepisodic memory, eyewitness testimony.\\nAbbreviations: SLI: speciﬁc language impairment.\\nUnderstanding children’s memory and the way it\\ndevelops is of crucial importance for psychologists andother academic and professional groups. From a theor-etical perspective, the goal of providing a full account ofthe many processes and systems involved in humanmemory can only be achieved if the changes that takeplace in memory abilities during childhood, which cul-minate in adult memory function, are also known. Thereare more practical reasons too for needing to know aboutmemory in childhood. Eﬀective methods of educationdepend upon teachers understanding the capacities ofchildren of diﬀerent ages to learn and remember in-formation.Without studyingmemorydevelopment,thesecapacities cannot be known. Equally importantly, poormemory function can impair a child’s opportunities tolearn, and can lead to many diﬀerent proﬁles of learningdisability. The assessment of memory abilities thereforeprovides a crucial method of understanding the proﬁlesof learning diﬃculties, and of identifying eﬀectivemethods for their remediation, in individual children. Inaddition, understanding the reliability of children’s mem-ories is becoming an issue of increasing importance asmore children are providing testimony in the courtroom.These issues of current educational and psycholegalrelevance underscore the impact of understandingchildren’s memory in everyday life as well as in thelaboratory.\\nIt must be emphasised that the singularity of the term\\n‘‘memory’’ is misleading: there is no single memory storeor system that underpins all mnemonic experience.\\nRequests for reprints to: Susan E. Gathercole, Centre for the\\nStudy of Memory and Learning, Department of Psychology,University of Bristol, 8 Woodland Road, Bristol BS8 1TN,U.K. (E-mail: Sue.Gathercole !bristol.ac.uk).Rather, evidence from a range of sources—experimental\\nstudies of adults, neuropsychological patients, brainimaging techniques, as well as investigations of children’smemory—indicates that there are many separable mem-ory systems that can function relatively independently ofone another. The present review of memory in childhoodis organised around widely accepted distinctions betweenthe following memory systems: short-term memory andtwo long-term memory systems—autobiographical mem-ory and episodic memory. These aspects of memory wereselected for review as they reﬂect areas of signiﬁcantresearch activities in children’s memory in which im-portant advances in understanding have been achieved inrecent years.\\nShort-term Memory\\nThe term ‘‘short-term memory’’ is used to refer to\\nmemory for events that occurred in the very recent past,where the delay between presentation of the material tobe remembered and remembering is measured in terms ofseconds and possibly minutes rather than hours or days.Research on human short-term memory dating back tothe early 1960s has led to a bedrock of knowledge aboutthe underpinnings of short-term memory performance.One fact which became apparent relatively early on is thatshort-term memory performance is not supported by aunitary short-term memory system, but is instead servedby a suite of distinct short-term memory systems. Themost complete current speciﬁcation of short-term mem-ory is the working memory model of Baddeley and Hitch(1974), revised by Baddeley in 1986. Although originallydevised to account for adult short-term memory per-formance, this model has proved to be of great value\\n3\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4704, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='db67caf2-403a-4f8b-b9ec-11668b243a3c', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3c99c285-5fe9-4a86-99da-9b0caf6c404f', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='3d2902d7ceb2d43c9c79df16ba49fcb45f1e8b6b56d2142e2b2248317118bf4d'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='9d80156b-08f6-4d1f-943d-334766f79e77', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='3156561dfa5b08aa3a254975b03fd11bb7273ac08da3e2d357d1abb670766d37'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7e2addd3-6e78-4737-819e-71299e38f216', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='c235da5a74225891b72598865a83268ae930e62c85ea5fbf0d6f7e67c31c5b2d')}, text='4 S.

For convenience, the working memorymodel is used here as a framework for presenting currentunderstanding of the nature of children’s memory de-velopment, although it should be noted that it is by nomeans the only account of short-term memory devel-opment (see, e.g., Cowan & Kail, 1996; Kail & Park,1994; Pascual-Leone & Baillargeon, 1994).\\nAccording to this model, working memory comprises\\nthreecomponents:the centralexecutive,the phonologicalloop, and the visuospatial sketchpad. The latter twocomponents, the phonological loop and the visuospatialsketchpad, were characterised by Baddeley and Hitch(1974), as ‘‘slave systems’’ that are specialised for theprocessing and manipulation of limited amounts ofinformation within highly speciﬁc domains. Material isstored in the phonological loop in terms of its sound-based phonological qualities, whereas the sketchpad hasthe capacity to maintain the spatial and visual propertiesof limited amounts of information. In contrast to thehighly speciﬁc informational domains in which these twoslave systems operate, the central executive is capable ofperforming a range of high-level functions. Functionsascribed to the central executive include the coordinationof the ﬂow of information through working memory, theretrieval of information from more permanent long-termmemory stores, the application of retrieval strategies,logical reasoning, and mental arithmetic (e.g. Baddeley,1986; Hitch, 1980).\\nThe theoretical speciﬁcation of each of these three\\ncomponents of working memory is by no means com-plete, and indeed is undergoing continuous revision in thelight both of new research and of the requirement forgreater theoretical speciﬁcation imposed by the devel-opment of computational models (Burgess & Hitch, 1992,1996). It is, however, notable that the basic tripartitedistinction between the central executive, phonologicalloop, and visuospatial sketchpad, based on experimentalstudies of normal adults, has received substantial in-dependent support in recent years from the developingneuroscience disciplines. Studies of both cognitive neuro-psychology and brain imaging have provided convergentevidence that both the brain areas and functional memorysystems mediating performance on phonological andvisuospatial short-term memory tasks are separate. In thecase of the phonological short-term memory system, theleft-hemisphere regions of Broca’s area and the prefrontalcortex are implicated, whereas visuospatial short-termmemory appears to be mediated by parietal and pre-frontal areas of the right hemisphere (Smith, Jonides, &Koeppe, 1996). Neuropsychological investigations haveyielded ﬁndings consistent with this view, that separatefunctional systems underpin phonological and visuo-spatial short-term memory. Neurological damage toparietal regions of the right hemisphere has been found toresult in marked deﬁcits in visual memory performancewhile verbal memory skills remain intact (Farah, 1988;Farah, Hamond, Levine, & Calvanio, 1988; Hanley,Young, & Pearson, 1991). Correspondingly, impairmentsin Broca’s area are associated with highly speciﬁc verbalshort-term memory deﬁcits but normal visuospatialmemory function (Basso, Spinnler, Vallar, & Zanobio,1982). These perspectives provide substantial conﬁr-mation that phonological and visuospatial short-term\\nmemory performance are mediated by functionally sep-arate memory systems, as the working memory modelproposes.\\nPhonological Short -term Memory\\nChildren’s level of performance on tests of phono-\\nlogical memory such as digit span and other serial recalltests increases dramatically over the early and middleyears of childhood. Memory span (a measure of themaximum number of unrelated verbal items that can beremembered in correct sequence) shows an average two-to three-fold increase from between two and three itemsat 4 years of age to about six items at 12 years.

Before considering these ﬁndings and their impli-cations, it is ﬁrst necessary to provide a brief charac-terisation of the working memory component, believed,on the basis of studies of adult memory, to be the mostsigniﬁcant contributor to memory span and other serialorder tasks: the phonological loop (Baddeley, 1986). Thissystem consists of two subcomponents: a phonologicalstore, and a subvocal rehearsal process. Informationgains access to the phonological store either directly, viaauditory presentation of speech stimuli, or indirectly viainternally generated phonological codes for nonauditoryinputs such as printed words or familiar visual objects.Phonological representations of memory items decayrapidly in the phonological store, and typically becomeindiscriminable within about 2 seconds if unrehearsed(Baddeley, Thomson, & Buchanan, 1975). Subvocalrehearsal occurs serially and in real time, and acts torefresh decaying representations in the phonologicalstore. In this way, decay of representations within thephonological store can be oﬀset if the entire contents ofthe store can be rehearsed within 2 seconds. The rehearsalprocess also appears to be the mechanism by whichrepresentations in the phonological store are generatedfor stimuli such as printed words and pictures, which canbe recorded in phonological form but are nonauditory innature.\\nEvidence that the phonological store is indeed phono-\\nlogical in nature is provided by the phonological simi-larity eﬀects. Immediate serial recall is substantiallyimpaired if the memory items are similar to one anotherin their phonological structure (e.g. B,C,V,G,D), even\\nif the stimuli were presented visually at input (Conrad& Hull, 1964). This ﬁnding, replicated many times inthe intervening years, provides a clear indication thatmaterial is held in terms of its sound characteristicswithin the phonological loop.\\nThe two key experimental ﬁndings in support of the\\nview that the subvocal rehearsal process serves to main-tain information within the phonological store are the\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=3311, end_char_idx=6561, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='037dca23-7f21-4b51-9678-fff027611d7d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='f2e680f6-76f0-4800-ab69-cd0c346f32fb', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='6dfd05b6c0d4bec87cbd4e70accae4ab78840f10dfd856af979389790d81adcb'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7e2addd3-6e78-4737-819e-71299e38f216', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='2503b545f3e5bd854544515f8ab42d33f19211d063f1d89aca1ade70881a315d'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7bab874a-2fa3-423f-9abc-5ba6ce5da22e', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='f9d748188d8e7a61bc80971770dfd59c247b3d193ce9355d105898fd8ce03bd3')}, text='5 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nFigure 1. Mean number of items (words) recalled, as a function of age group. Based on data\\nfrom Hulme, Muir, Thomson, and Lawrence (1984).\\nword length and articulatory suppression phenomena.\\nThe word length eﬀect, initially established by Baddeleyet al. (1975), refers to the better serial recall of memorylists containing memory items with short names (e.g. one-syllable words such as cat,sun,bat) than those with long\\nnames (e.g. banana ,telephone ,piano). This phenomenon\\nhas been attributed to the subvocal rehearsal componentof the phonological loop. As rehearsal is believed to takelonger for items of long than short articulatory durationthere is a greater delay between successive rehearsals oflengthier items within the phonological store, providinggreater opportunity for loss of information due to decay.This account ﬁts well with ﬁndings that the word lengtheﬀect is eliminated when rehearsal is prevented byrequiring participants to engage in irrelevant articulationduring the memory task, a procedure known as ‘‘articu-latory suppression’’ (Baddeley, Lewis, & Vallar, 1984;Baddeley et al., 1975). It is argued that in this situation,the time-based rehearsal process cannot be engaged andso the beneﬁt of short over long memory items in the\\nphonological loop is lost.\\nThe development of the phonological loop . Investi-\\ngations of the sensitivity of children’s immediate memoryto these experimental variables have yielded evidence forhighly speciﬁc changes in phonological loop functionwith age. It appears that the phonological store com-ponent of the phonological loop is present even in veryyoung children, but that the subvocal rehearsal processdoes not emerge until about 7 years of age (Gathercole &Hitch, 1993). Provided that the memory items arepresented auditorily and so do not require subvocalrehearsal to gain access to the phonological loop,children’s immediate serial recall is sensitive to phono-logical similarity and word length at the youngest agegroups tested—between 3 and 5 years of age (Ford &Silber, 1994; Gathercole & Adams, 1994; Hitch &Halliday, 1983; Hulme et al., 1984).

GATHERCOLE\\nage are not impaired when memory items have labels that\\nare either lengthy in articulatory duration or are phono-logically similar to one another, relative to children aged7 years and older (Hitch, Halliday, Dodd, & Littler,1989). Rather than recoding the pictures into the phono-logical form required for entry into the phonologicalstore, younger children appear to attempt to remembersuch memory stimuli in terms of their visual character-istics (Hitch, Halliday, Schaafstal, & Schraagen, 1988;Longoni & Scalisi, 1994).\\nOther ﬁndings too ﬁt well with this view that young\\nchildren fail to exploit a rehearsal strategy for non-auditory memory stimuli. One of the earliest methods ofidentifying rehearsal was to observe whether childrenperforming immediate memory tasks produced any overtsigns of rehearsal such as lip movements and whisperingin the interval between memory presentations. Using thistechnique, Flavell, Beach, and Chinsky (1966) failed toﬁnd any evidence for rehearsal in children below 7 yearsof age.\\nA diﬀerent approach to the issue of when rehearsal\\nemerges was taken by Johnston, Johnson, and Gray(1987) in a study of 5-year-old children. When theirimmediate serial recall was initially tested with sequencesof nameable pictures, the children showed no sensitivityto whether the pictures names were long or short inarticulatory duration. Johnson et al. then gave thechildren training in the use of overt and covert cumulativerehearsal strategies in serial recall. When tested followingthis training, the children did show superior recall ofpictures with short over those with long names. Thisstudy provides direct evidence, ﬁrst that subvocal re-hearsal is not used spontaneously at this age, and secondthat this strategy can be induced with training. It also ﬁtswell with the notion that the word length eﬀect arisesfrom the rehearsal process, which is, as we shall seeshortly, a matter of some contention.\\nA third line of support for the view that rehearsal is not\\nused in early childhood arises from studies in whichmeasures of both auditory memory span and of the rateat which the children can articulate the memory itemswere taken. According to the view advanced earlier,access to the phonological store for auditorily presentedmaterial takes place without rehearsal, although repre-sentations in the phonological store do not receive thebeneﬁt of constant refreshment provided by rehearsal inyounger age groups. Consistent with this view, articu-lation rate and memory span are not positively correlatedwith one another for children below 7 years of age(Cowan et al., 1994; Gathercole & Adams, 1993;Gathercole, Adams, & Hitch, 1994; Henry, 1994). Foradults, in contrast, strongly positive associations arefound (Gathercole et al., 1994). The implication of thisdevelopmental change is that young children, unlikeadults, do not depend on a time-based (rehearsal) strategyto maintain the contents of their phonological stores; thespeed at which they articulate, therefore, does not matter.\\nAlthough there is now ample evidence in support of the\\nview that rehearsal does not spontaneously emerge beforethe middle childhood years, some puzzles remain. Onearea of uncertainty concerns the source of word lengtheﬀects in serial recall. With auditory presentation, evenvery young children show poorer recall of lists of longthan short words (Gathercole & Adams, 1994; Hitch &\\nHalliday, 1983; Hulme et al., 1984). This should not be soif the children cannot rehearse. The most likely ex-planation is that word length eﬀects in short-termmemory do not arise solely from rehearsal. There isaccumulating evidence that the greater delay in outputinvolved in the spoken recall of lengthy over shortmemory items may itself be suﬃcient to cause extra decayinthe phonological store andhence impairrecall accuracy(Avons, Wight, & Pammer, 1994; Brown & Hulme, 1995;Cowan et al., 1992). Consistent with this view, childrenbelow 7 years of age show no word length eﬀect even forauditory material if memory performance is not sampledby a serial spoken recall procedure and hence is notsubject to diﬀerential output delays for short and longitems (Henry, 1991).', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4184, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='d32c166a-bb84-445e-8628-8f95cf481e6a', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='6bf9ebba-1695-41e7-bf74-61e473464b15', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='fcbce4fca998a31f46c6ac64922c1cbc1525d81991eae042d4d3e81e3a406029'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7bab874a-2fa3-423f-9abc-5ba6ce5da22e', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='ee76ac5bf2582472a5c25e586f8f6324bccfed34e3640442308577796f13d90f'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='1e8c9756-b4cc-4929-a32b-072c9a0ccae9', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='17d8632ed995f8fe7e3018e7e66d389da4966e51d20daf42eee93bfc4f57a885')}, text='This should not be soif the children cannot rehearse. The most likely ex-planation is that word length eﬀects in short-termmemory do not arise solely from rehearsal. There isaccumulating evidence that the greater delay in outputinvolved in the spoken recall of lengthy over shortmemory items may itself be suﬃcient to cause extra decayinthe phonological store andhence impairrecall accuracy(Avons, Wight, & Pammer, 1994; Brown & Hulme, 1995;Cowan et al., 1992). Consistent with this view, childrenbelow 7 years of age show no word length eﬀect even forauditory material if memory performance is not sampledby a serial spoken recall procedure and hence is notsubject to diﬀerential output delays for short and longitems (Henry, 1991).\\nThe principal developmental change in phonological\\nshort-term memory identiﬁed so far is that prior to about7 years of age, serial recall performance is mediated by thephonological store component of the phonological loop.During the preschool and early school years, however, itdoes not appear likely that children use a subvocalrehearsal strategy to maintain the decaying phonologicalrepresentations in the store. Rather, they choose toremember pictures by recalling visual features. Beyond 7years, an adult-like cumulative rehearsal strategy emergesand is employed to maximise retention in the phono-logical store. From this point onwards, nonauditorymemory material is recoded into a phonological codesuitable for the phonological loop when possible. Thecontinuing increases in articulation rate up to the latechildhood years enhance the eﬀectiveness of the subvocalrehearsal process and hence give rise to further improve-ments in memory span beyond the onset of rehearsal.\\nThis model of developmental change provides a good\\naccount of a wide range of experimental data, althoughthe account is by no means complete. One outstandingissue concerns the fact that memory span increasesdevelopmentally even prior to the period at whichchildren learn to use rehearsal (e.g. Gathercole & Adams,1994). Why is this? One possibility is that span increasesduring the period up to 7 years of age because olderchildren are able to articulate items more rapidly at recall,and hence are able to reduce the decay of memory itemsin the phonological store prior to output. The necessaryﬁne-grained analyses of developmental change in im-mediate memory span in the pre-rehearsal period, whichwould allow a direct test of this hypothesis, have not,however, yet been conducted.\\nNote that the account presented above explains de-\\nvelopmental increases in memory span in terms ofincreased rates of articulation, both during the pre-rehearsal period (when its locus is in spoken output) andthe post-rehearsal period (when its sources are probablyin both covert rehearsal and spoken output). If thisaccount is true, diﬀerences in memory span between agegroups should be eliminated if their articulation rates areheld constant. Two studies have tested this hypothesis,and found that changes in articulation rates provide asigniﬁcant but only partial account of the increase inmemory span during childhood (Henry & Millar, 1991;Roodenrys, Hulme, & Brown, 1993).

De-velopmental changes in phonological loop function there-fore do not provide a full explanation of why memoryspan increases with age. So what else changes?\\nLong-term knowledge and immediate memory in chil -\\ndren. To explain why the phonological loop might not\\nprovide a complete account of age-related increases inimmediate memory in childhood, it is necessary to returnto the working memory model. Although the phono-logical loop is the component that is specialised for theretention and manipulation of information in a phono-logical form, and may be the single most importantcontributor to immediate memory, other memorysystems and processes have also long been known to playa role (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974). One particularlysigniﬁcant source of additional support for immediaterecall of verbal material comes from long-term storage oflexical knowledge, or the mental lexicon. Its contributionto immediate serial recall is simply demonstrated by thesubstantial recall advantage to memory sequences con-taining familiar words, such as gorilla ,radio, andbotany ,\\nover lists containing nonwords, such as taﬀost ,crepog ,\\nandteggid (Hulme, Maughan, & Brown, 1991). As the\\nword and nonword memory stimuli do not diﬀer inarticulatory duration or amount of phonological in-formation, the lexicality eﬀect (i.e. the recall advantage toword over nonword lists) must arise from the additionalavailability of long-term knowledge about the familiarwords. A series of studies by Hulme and colleaguessuggests that the lexicality eﬀect is mediated by the useof long-term phonological knowledge about the soundsof words rather than stored nonphonological attributessuch as word meaning (Brown & Hulme, 1992; Hulmeet al., 1991). These researchers suggest that stored phono-logical knowledge about the structures of words is usedto ‘‘ﬁll in’’ incomplete information in representations ofwords in the phonological store, in a process describedas redintegration (see, too, Schweikert, 1993). With non-word stimuli, of course, there is no such existing long-term speciﬁcation with which to recover missing in-formation in the phonological trace.\\nTheundoubtedcontributionoflong-termlexicalknow-\\nledge to immediate memory raises an interesting possi-bility. Could one source of the developmental improve-ment in verbal memory span, that is not due to increasedarticulation rate, be the magnitude of the lexical con-tribution? Findings of Roodenrys et al. (1993) suggestthat this might be the case. Comparing memory span in 6-\\nand 10-year-old children, they found a relatively greater\\nadvantage of memory for words over nonwords in theolder group that could not be accounted for in terms ofdiﬀerences in articulatory speed between the groups orthe stimuli. Although narrowly missing statistical signiﬁ-cance, this ﬁnding provides preliminary support for theview that older children develop more extensive andstable long-term knowledge about words, and that thiscan be used to increasing beneﬁt to supplement phono-logical loop representations of lexical items.\\nThere is also evidence that a more basic kind of long-\\nterm knowledge about the structure of the nativelanguage mediates immediate memory performance, evenwhen nonwords are the memory stimuli: this is knowl-edge about the probabilistic structure of sound com-\\nbinations in the language. Across several studies(Gathercole, 1995; Gathercole & Martin, 1996;Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1991), we havefound that children are better at repeating multisyllabicnonword stimuli when the wordlikeness of the nonwords,as judged by adults, is high (e.g. ‘‘commerine’’) than low(e.g. ‘‘loddernaypish’’). Similarly, children recall non-word sequences more accurately if the nonwords containadjacent phoneme pairs that are high in probabilityof occurrence within English (Gathercole, Frankish,Pickering, & Peaker, 1997).

Theseﬁndings are encouraging, and a key priority for futureresearch is to provide a much more complete devel-opmental analysis of the use of both lexical and phono-tactic knowledge in children’s immediate verbal memory.\\nDevelopmental impairments of phonological short -term\\nmemory . One notable feature of children’s performance\\non tests of phonological short-term memory is the highdegree of variability across individuals. Although mem-ory span increases regularly across age when assessed onthe basis of group data at each chronological point, verylarge diﬀerences are found in span estimates for in-dividual children at any one age. For unselected cohortsof young children, these diﬀerences in phonologicalmemory capacity have been found to relate closely to twoimportant aspects of language development: vocabularyacquisition (e.g. Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989, 1993;Gathercole, Willis, Emslie, & Baddeley, 1992; Michas& Henry, 1994), and speech production (Adams &Gathercole, 1995, 1996; Blake, Austin, Cannon, Lisus,& Vaughan, 1994; Speidel, 1989, 1991).\\nThese and related ﬁndings have led to the proposal that\\na primary function of the phonological loop is to supportlanguage learning (Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, inpress; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1993). Consistent withthis view, children with speciﬁc language impairment have\\nbeen found to have extremely poor phonological short-term memory function.

For many children diagnosedas speciﬁc language impaired, a genetic origin seemslikely (Bishop, North, & Donlan, 1996; Gopnik & Crago,1991).\\nA variety of accounts of the central deﬁcit under-\\npinning SLI have been advanced over many years (seeBishop, 1992, for review). Current inﬂuential theories ofSLI include those identifying impairments in generalprocessing resource (Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996;Masterson & Kamhi, 1992), rapid perceptual processing(Merzenich et al., 1996; Stark & Heinz, 1996; Tallalet al., 1996), and grammatical morphology (Leonard,McGregor, & Allen, 1992; Gopnik & Crago, 1991). It isnoteworthy that research on these aspects of putative SLIdeﬁcits typically depends upon a methodology in whichSLI children are compared with their age-matchedcontrols. This is problematic, as it is unclear whether it isappropriate to characterise the SLI children as eitherdisordered in this particular aspect of cognitive orperceptual processing, or performing at a languageability-appropriate level. Consistent with the latter ‘‘de-velopment lag’’ interpretation, when comparisons aremade between SLI groups and language-matched con-trols the common pattern often yields no diﬀerencesbetween groups (e.g. Visto, Cranford, & Scudder, 1996).\\nOn the other hand, the SLI children have consistently\\nbeen found to underperform even younger language-matched controls on tests of phonological short-termmemory. Their deﬁcit is particularly marked when pro-cedures such as nonword repetition that use phono-logically unfamiliar stimuli are employed (Gathercole &Baddeley, 1990; Gillam, Cowan, & Day, 1995; Gillam &van Kleeck, 1996; James, van Steenbrugge, & Chiveralls,1994; Kail, Hale, Leonard, & Nippold, 1984;Montgomery, 1995). For example, the SLI group studiedby Gathercole and Baddeley (1990) had a mean chrono-logical age of 8, performed at the level of an average 6-year-old on standardised language tests of vocabularyknowledge, language comprehension, and reading, buthad nonword repetition accuracy scores of the typical 4-year-old child. The problems in nonword repetition ofthis SLI group, as in the groups in the other studies citedabove, therefore far outweigh even their poor perform-ance on language measures that are the criterion variablesfor speciﬁc language impairment (e.g. Stark & Tallal,1981). Furthermore, a recent study of SLI and controltwins by Bishop et al. (1996) has yielded high heritabilityestimates for nonword repetition, which, the authorssuggest, may provide an excellent phenotypic marker forthe SLI condition.\\nAlthough the data on phonological memory in SLI\\nchildren are largely consistent across studies, theoreticalinterpretation of the source of the SLI deﬁcits on tests ofnonword repetition and serial recall remains at present amatter of debate. The view that we have advanced is thatthese deﬁcits arise from extreme limitations in phono-logical loop capacity, probably located in the phono-logical store rather than in the subvocal rehearsal process,which appears to operate at a language-appropriate levelin SLI children (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1990, 1993). It isthis poor temporary storage of incoming speech stimuli,we propose, that may lie at the root of the diﬃcultiesencountered by SLI children in establishing durable long-\\nterm phonological representations of novel words (e.g.Dollaghan, 1987; Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996; Rice,Buhr, & Nemeth, 1991). The phonological storage deﬁcitmay also contribute to the impaired abilities of SLIchildren to learn complex syntactic patterns, in themanner suggested by Adams and Gathercole (1995, 1996)and Speidel (1991).', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3714, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='a9ba4963-6efc-4101-9a5b-3beb776236b3', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='772b4eab-176c-42b2-b553-eacf4567fc1f', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='1197790dbc02a7c24e73fa041d452291f2d3d4e13d324a742618c786f10c3dfc'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a9ef2aea-4137-4d1e-9289-866dbbf8edce', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='403f5222da9f4f851c3c39f366a1b01e7558c09d4ca87b17a2899ceb653d63b7'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5f1c8a7a-8c53-42d6-8aef-996e12b5183d', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='bb5298b3caf2f6d1f0e77bca979b862b6d4ecc5114e411ba61b83ab7947e66e1')}, text='It isthis poor temporary storage of incoming speech stimuli,we propose, that may lie at the root of the diﬃcultiesencountered by SLI children in establishing durable long-\\nterm phonological representations of novel words (e.g.Dollaghan, 1987; Ellis Weismer & Hesketh, 1996; Rice,Buhr, & Nemeth, 1991).

One problem for the account is that there aresome indications that SLI children are impaired inperceptual processing of nonword stimuli as well as intheir repetition, raising the possibility that their poorperformance on the memory tasks is secondary to poorperceptual skills (James et al., 1994; Montgomery, 1995).The detailed deﬁcits of the SLI children on perceptualdiscrimination tasks are, however, inconsistent acrossthese two studies. It is particularly notable thatMontgomery only found reliable deﬁcits in perceptualdiscrimination in his SLI group when pairs of lengthy(four-syllable) nonwords were presented for discrimi-nation. But as the eight-syllable memory load involved inmaintaining the two stimuli in order to make thecomparison is likely to considerably exceed the storagecapacity of the SLI children, this ﬁnding need notnecessarily indicate a perceptual deﬁcit at all. Furtherinvestigation of this issue is required, using procedures inwhich perceptual and short-term storage contributions toperformance are varied more systematically.\\nAnalysis of the long-term memory involvement in\\nimmediate phonological memory performance in SLIchildren is also needed in the light of recent advances inunderstanding the signiﬁcance of both lexical and phono-tactic knowledge to tasks such as nonword repetition andmemory span (Gathercole, 1995; Gathercole et al., 1997;Hulme et al., 1991; Roodenrys et al., 1993). It is possiblethat at least some of the deﬁciency in the performance ofSLI children on these tasks may arise from impoverisheduse of either of both lexical and phonotactic knowledge tosupplement phonological loop storage of memory items.By applying the techniques developed recently in studiesof unselected samples of children to SLI groups, thesehypotheses can now be readily put to the empirical test.\\nSummary . Phonological short-term memory abilities\\ndevelop rapidly through the early and middle childhoodyears. Much of this development appears to arise fromdevelopmental increases in the speed of rehearsing and ofretrieving material from memory, and from the emerg-ence of subvocal rehearsal as a strategy for introducingnonauditory material into the phonological loop and foractively maintaining the contents of the phonologicalstore. Children’s phonological memory capacity hasimportant consequences for their abilities to learn newwords, and the very poor phonological memory skillstypically found in children with speciﬁc language im-pairment may lie at the root of their failure to developlanguage normally.\\nIt is becoming increasingly apparent that immediate\\nmemory performance also reﬂects the contribution to\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=3205, end_char_idx=6758, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='5f1c8a7a-8c53-42d6-8aef-996e12b5183d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='979fd6e4-549e-4e5d-943b-30a4221bbf89', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='11cee3b40718746ddf193cec9c6f2e510b8b64595766a8b4407a07771bee390e'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='a9ba4963-6efc-4101-9a5b-3beb776236b3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='62eaeb4ac06f9576960eb92acd3677a41165f71ea09287219a87f83449e29fc8'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='045cfb51-36bb-4dec-8a0d-c93693348fd9', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='436750ec6cf323dcef389da9a4352e27c5ee50a9305d22177ecc19f3844bd6bc')}, text='9 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nlong-term knowledge, both of familiar words and of the\\nprobabilistic structure of sound patterns within the nativelanguage. New techniques for assessing the extent ofthese long-term memory contributions should allowsystematic evaluation of whether these are the source ofage diﬀerences in phonological memory that do notreﬂect changes in the operation of the phonological loop.\\nVisuospatial Short -term Memory\\nBaddeley and Hitch (1974) proposed that our ca-\\npacities to remember and manipulate mentally the physi-cal features and dimensions of events such as shape,colour, and movement are served by a diﬀerent limited-capacitycomponentofworkingmemory:the visuospatialsketchpad. Subsequent experimental studies have lentstrong support to this dissociation between the memorysystems contributing to short-term memory for verbaland visuospatial material (e.g. Logie, Zucco, & Baddeley,1990; Smyth & Scholey, 1996).\\nLogie (1994) has recently proposed that the sketchpad,\\nlike the phonological loop, has two primary subcom-ponents: a visual store in which the physical character-istics of objects and events can be represented, and aspatial mechanism that can be used for planning move-ments and that may also serve a rehearsal function byreactivating the contents of the visual store. Although inpractice very little memory material can purely becharacterised in terms of either visual or spatial features,this distinction between the capacities for visual andspatial processing is certainly consistent with neuro-psychological evidence of preserved visual but not spatialmemory (Farah et al., 1988) and vice versa (Hanley et al.,1991). It also ﬁts well with selective interference ofmemory for spatial information by concurrent spatialactivity (Baddeley & Lieberman, 1980), and of irrelevantvisual material on memory for visual items (Logie, 1986;Quinn & McConnell, 1996).\\nThe development of the visuospatial sketchpad . Al-\\nthough the ways in which the operation of the visuo-spatial sketchpad changes with age during childhoodhave not been as extensively researched as those of thephonological loop, there is now a basic understanding ofsome signiﬁcant changes in its functioning. One im-portant change is that younger children are more de-pendent than older children or adults on using thesketchpad to support immediate memory for visualmaterial. Hitch et al. (1988) demonstrated that in a task inwhich a series of pictures of nameable objects arepresented for recall, 5-year-old children are impaired inrecalling memory lists in which the objects share manyphysical features (e.g. pen,fork,comb,key) over those\\nwith few shared features (e.g. doll,bath,glove,spoon). A\\ngroup of 10-year-old children, in contrast, showed nosensitivity in recall to the visual similarity of the pictures,but were impaired when the pictures had lengthy names(e.g.umbrella ,kangaroo ,policeman ,banana ). These and\\nother ﬁndings reported by Hitch et al. and Hitch,Woodin, and Baker (1989) indicate that older childrenadopt a strategy of verbally recoding pictures wherepossible and so use the phonological loop to mediateperformance on the ‘‘visual’’ memory task. As youngchildren are not able to generate phonological codes forvisual items covertly, they are forced to rely instead on\\ntheir recall of the purely visuospatial characteristics ofthe memory stimuli.\\nIn order to provide a pure assessment of the de-\\nvelopment of visuospatial memory capacities, it is there-fore important to use memory tasks in which the stimulido not correspond to familiar items that can reliably berecoded into phonological form. One such paradigm thathas been employed as a means of assessing primarily thevisual component of the sketchpad is the pattern spantask (Wilson, Scott, & Power, 1987). In this task, a two-dimensional pattern composed of squares that are eitherﬁlled or unﬁlled is brieﬂy displayed on each trial. Thechild is then showed the same pattern with a single ﬁlledblock missing, and is required to point to its originallocation. The number of blocks in the test patterns arethen increased until memory accuracy falls below acriterionlevel,yieldingfor each individualaspan measureof number of blocks reliably remembered.\\nUsing this technique, Wilson et al.

Similar patternsof development of visual pattern span were also obtainedby Miles, Morgan, Milne, and Morris (1996). In theirstudy, the method of memory test was varied from thepartial recall procedure used by Wilson et al. to rec-ognition (in which condition the participants had to judgewhich of a pair of patterns had been studied previously)and free recall (in which a blank matrix was presented,and the task was to point to the squares that were ﬁlled inthe test stimulus). In each case, relatively steep devel-opmental increases were obtained across groups ofchildren aged 5, 7, and 10 years, and adults, with spanestimates lower across all ages in the more time-con-suming free recall condition. We have recently replicatedthe developmental function for the free recall version ofthe pattern span task (Pickering, Gathercole, & Hall,1997).\\nIt may, however, be misleading to interpret this\\ndevelopmental proﬁle solely in terms of age-relatedchanges in the capacity of the sketchpad to retain visualinformation. Despite the apparently nonverbal nature ofthe pattern span test stimuli, both the Wilson et al. (1987)and Miles et al. (1996) studies provide strong evidencethat a substantial component of the developmentalincrease in pattern span arises from the contribution ofmemory components other than the visuospatial sketch-pad. Wilson et al. (1987) tested pattern span under avariety of concurrent task conditions, and found thatinterpolating a 10-second interval of spoken arithmetic-related activity (counting backwards aloud for oldergroups, forward counting for the youngest age group)between presentation of the pattern and recalling itreduced pattern span considerably, and that the mag-nitude of this disruption increased progressively between5 and 11 years. Engaging in irrelevant mental arithmeticis widely believed to require the involvement of thecentralexecutive (Baddeley &Hitch, 1974), and irrelevantarticulation appears to block subvocal rehearsal\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=3617, end_char_idx=6651, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='8240050c-d20f-4007-97d9-7a5bb26c56b6', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '8', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='f27e7d4a-57d0-448b-88f7-0ceaaff2e64a', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '8', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='90b4eb5eb34c266336f4900f88abba9978b9063399ffde4261bbafccc7068285'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='045cfb51-36bb-4dec-8a0d-c93693348fd9', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='e874c6d56597f3e22efa2bad6b2325822d918d69a3ce9cca4212918730c8c664'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='aa359542-c603-4fe9-b222-89ab407b3a92', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='2a4e9ac53d6abed6e011951cfa7134faa12df38281b6f0b271885058c05899c7')}, text='10 S.

Thus, the disruptive eﬀect of\\nspoken mental arithmetic on pattern span for olderchildren and adults indicates signiﬁcant involvement ofeither or both of these two nonvisual components ofworking memory in the pattern span task. At least someof the increase in children’s capacities to retain visualpatterns therefore appears to reﬂect increasing use ofnonvisual strategies to mediate memory performance,rather than enhanced visual memory per se.\\nDue to the nature of the interpolated task used by\\nWilson et al. (1987), their data do not identify whetherolder children are using the phonological loop to sup-plement the visuospatial sketchpad in the pattern span(by verbally recoding the stimuli) or the central executive.Other ﬁndings indicate that both of these components ofworking memory may play a role. Earlier work withadults had already established that recall of similarmatrix-style visual patterns is greatly disrupted by sub-sequent silent mental arithmetic (Phillips & Christie,1977), implicating central executive involvement inmemory for patterns. And Miles et al. (1996) found thatconcurrent articulatory suppression, which blocks the useof the phonological loop, signiﬁcantly impaired patternspans for the 10-year-old and adult groups, particularlyon the recognition and partial recall versions of the task.\\nThe disruption in visual pattern span caused by prevent-ing rehearsal in the Miles et al. study was considerablyless substantial than that observed by Wilson et al. with aconcurrent task loading on both the central executive andthe phonological loop. It therefore seems plausible thatolder participants in these studies were able to engage ina range of nonvisual strategies to supplement the contri-bution of the sketchpad, which called upon (possiblyacross diﬀerent trials and diﬀerent individuals) both ofthese nonvisual components of working memory.\\nSo, children’s capacities to retain visual patterns over\\nshort intervals increase greatly between 5 and 11 years ofage, by which time adult levels of performance are moreor less achieved. The developmental increase appears tobe due in part to a genuine increase in the capacity of thesketchpad to hold material in visual form, but also toincreasing use of nonvisual strategies using both thephonological loop and the central executive to sup-plement memory performance.\\nOne important issue that has not been directly ad-\\ndressed as yet is whether the increased visuospatialsketchpad contribution over this developmental periodsimply reﬂects an undiﬀerentiated increase in the capacity\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=2810, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='aa359542-c603-4fe9-b222-89ab407b3a92', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '9', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='fa77c218-27ae-4b2f-ad02-cee4ad4991b3', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '9', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='5b12eba871e4f2292176bfdd1a5d116a50bd134c0c81ed65bd1eed213ff471ce'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='8240050c-d20f-4007-97d9-7a5bb26c56b6', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '8', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='90b4eb5eb34c266336f4900f88abba9978b9063399ffde4261bbafccc7068285'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5861bd32-f67f-4891-9e7d-732558f1c332', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='e6a0b37a4dfa77cff6f80ae8b9dd25d49a97c9bb1d65ffee4a3976ff0c58d4f2')}, text='11 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nDigit span\\nCorsi span\\nFigure 3.

Evidence reviewed aboveindicates that a signiﬁcant component of the develop-mental increase in the neighbouring phonological loopsystem does reﬂect the emergence of an active rehearsalstrategy, which acts to maintain representations in themore passive store component; this could also be true ofthe visuospatial sketchpad. There are now concurrenttask techniques available that are known to disrupt thetwo components selectively; the visual store appears to beimpaired by irrelevant visual information (Logie, 1986;Quinn & McConnell, 1996) whereas tapping impairsspatial memory (Smyth & Pendleton, 1989). By applyingthese techniques, it should be possible in future researchto analyse the contributions of the visual and spatialcomponents of the sketchpad to the developmentalchanges in visual memory already established.\\nSome basic information is, however, known about\\nchanges in abilities to retain spatial information with age.The method that has been used to test spatial memory inchildren is the Corsi blocks task. In this task, a three-dimensional display of nine blocks is placed in front ofthe participant, who observes the experimenter tappingthe blocks in an unsystematic sequence. The task is torepeat the activity, tapping the same blocks in the samesequence. As in the digit span task, the number of\\nmemory items (blocks in the case of the Corsi task,numbers in digit span) increases regularly up to the pointat which the participant can no longer reliably reproducethe correct sequence, and a span estimate is obtained.\\nThe developmental course of children’s memory spans\\non both the digit span and Corsi blocks tasks wasinvestigated by Isaacs and Vargha-Khadem (1989), in astudy of children aged between 7 and 15 years. As shownin Fig. 3, both span tasks showed a regular increaseacross this age range corresponding to about 1 ±5 items of\\nspan, with Corsi spans at each age lagging about one itemof span behind digit span. One interesting feature of thisstudy was that for both the verbal and spatial span tasks,children were tested on their forward and backward recallof the test sequences. Digit span is greatly impaired by therequirement to recall in backwards order, in line withnormative data on forward and backward digit spanprovided by standardised ability tests such as the WISC-R (Wechsler, 1982). What was not known prior to theIsaacs and Vargha-Khadem study was that in contrast,Corsi span is equivalent whether recall is tested in aforwards or backwards order. This indicates that orderinformation is extracted in a fundamentally diﬀerentmanner from spatial memory than from the phonologicalloop.

In an initial study, 5- and 8-year-old childrenwere tested on conventional measures of pattern span,Corsi block recall, and digit span. Scores on each taskwere uncorrelated with one another, suggesting thatphonological, visual, and spatial memory capacities maybe dissociable even in young children (see also, Pickering,Gathercole, & Peaker, in press).\\nIn a subsequent study, we constructed versions of the\\npattern span and Corsi blocks tasks that were directlycomparable except in temporal order. Our pattern spanstimuli were arrays of squares containing equal numbersof ﬁlled and unﬁlled blocks, similar to those employed byWilson et al. (1987). The task of the child was to studyeach pattern for 2 seconds on a computer screen, and thento indicate on an empty square the locations of the ﬁlledblocks in the test item. This method of test corresponds tothe free recall technique used by Miles et al. (1996). Spanwas estimated in the usual way by increasing the numberof squares in the test items until the children were unableto perform accurately.\\nIn the corresponding spatial task, the child viewed on\\nthe screen an initially empty square, in which blocksbecame ﬁlled one at a time. The child’s task at the end ofthe sequence was to point to the squares that had beenﬁlled at presentation in the same order as they hadoccurred on the screen. This provides a two-dimensionalanalogue of the conventional three-dimensional versionof the Corsi blocks task. Across our pattern and spatialtasks, the item content (i.e. the location of the ﬁlledblocks in the squares) was equivalent, as was the methodof recall. The tasks only diﬀered in the presence of orderinformation and the requirement to recall it in the spatialversion. Children aged 5, 7 and 10 years participated inthese tasks.\\nTwo noteworthy ﬁndings emerged from the study.\\nFirst, scores on the pattern span and spatial span wereuncorrelated with one another, despite the close cor-respondence between the information content and para-digms employed in the two cases. This reinforces theconclusion that diﬀerent memory capacities may under-pin memory for visual material with and without atemporal dimension, and is broadly consistent with thedistinction between a visual store and a spatial move-ment-based system in the sketchpad (Logie, 1994).\\nSecond, there was an age-related increase in span in\\nboth tasks. This function was, however, much steeper forthe pattern span than spatial span task: whereas the twospan estimates were similar in the youngest age groups,the beneﬁts to pattern span over spatial span were verysubstantial indeed by 10 years of age. At a general level,the diﬀerent gradients of the spatial and pattern spanfunctions lend further weight to the view that they areserved by diﬀerent memory systems. More speciﬁcally,the steeper increase in pattern span with age may reﬂecttheincreasingusebyolderchildrenofnonvisualstrategiesto supplement their memory for the visual patterns (inline with ﬁndings of Wilson et al., 1987; and Miles et al.,\\n1996) but not for the temporal order of the elements in thespatial task. This interpretation requires conﬁrmationusing dual task techniques; if correct, it indicates thatmemory for spatial information distributed across time isextremely restricted, and does not enjoy the opportunityfor other sources of memory support that are availablefor purely visual conﬁgurations.\\nIn summary, the capacity to retain information about\\nthe visuospatial characteristics of events for short periodsof time is mediated by a short-term memory systemdissociated from the phonological loop, and may consistof dissociable visual and spatial }temporal subcom-\\nponents. Although young children can retain both kindsof information in memory, their abilities to do so undergosubstantial increases between 5 and 11 years of age, whenshort-term memory capacity approaches adult levels.\\nImpairmentsofthevisuospatialsketchpad .', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4314, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='f546cfeb-4967-42bc-b964-e47be5f72a0d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7ac838e2-2a7c-438d-855e-b3af909da74d', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='45062fcf78c3e63544f182a095eeb9a0b11fe4927b8d7068c7997c131bc8693c'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='5861bd32-f67f-4891-9e7d-732558f1c332', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='3c4c8d224f7a45b7ba36ade5454e185ceb4adcc822470bc6a9f28ec900565466'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='ff2e8b69-a97d-4049-9293-e2564c6ae1f8', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='041f7c8a22477f3a181cd9ac544a668750a0e3570d4e4e0a723ba4b300ae67b5')}, text='This interpretation requires conﬁrmationusing dual task techniques; if correct, it indicates thatmemory for spatial information distributed across time isextremely restricted, and does not enjoy the opportunityfor other sources of memory support that are availablefor purely visual conﬁgurations.\\nIn summary, the capacity to retain information about\\nthe visuospatial characteristics of events for short periodsof time is mediated by a short-term memory systemdissociated from the phonological loop, and may consistof dissociable visual and spatial }temporal subcom-\\nponents.

Thesketch-\\npad, as tapped primarily by tasks requiring the retentionof meaningless verbal material such as grids containingcells ﬁlled at random, shows a regular developmentalincrease in capacity during the early school years. What,though, is the sketchpad used for in real life? Why is itthere? One potential answer is that the sketchpadprovides the facility to engage in mental imagery; theextent to which everyday cognitive activities call uponthis facility is, however, unclear.\\nAnother possibility is that the temporary storage\\ncapacity of the visuospatial sketchpad mediates the long-term learning of the visual and spatial coordinates ofnovel objects, in much the same way as the phonologicalloop appears to be crucial in supporting the learning ofthe sounds of new words. This idea is supported by astudy by Hanley et al. (1991) of a neuropsychologicalpatient, ELD, who had very poor short-term visuospatialmemory (including lower Corsi block span) followingdamage to the right hemisphere. Most interestingly, aftersustaining the brain damage ELD was unable to learnnew routes such as the way back to her new ﬂat or to learnto recognise the faces of previously unfamiliar people.\\nPerhaps, then, the sketchpad is used in childhood, as in\\nlater life, to support the learning of new visual and spatialinformation. If this is the case, we might expect thatconcurrent activities known to disturb selectively theoperation of the visuospatial sketchpad should alsoimpair the long-term learning of faces and routes. Therehas, however, been no systematic evaluation to date ofthe consequences for either face or route learning ofblocking components of working memory.\\nIf the sketchpad is crucial for learning as well as short-\\nterm retention, it should also follow that the substantialindividual diﬀerences in children’s abilities to retain suchmaterial over short periods of time (Cornoldi, Vecchia, &Tressoldi, 1995) should be closely related to their skills atrecognising new faces and learning spatial routes. Morespeciﬁcally, children with severely compromised abilitiesto maintain visuospatial information temporarily shouldalso be impaired on these real-life visuospatial learningtasks. One group who provide the opportunity to test thelatter hypothesis are children with Williams syndrome, arare genetic disorder leading to learning disabilities thatare considerably more substantial in the aspects ofvisuospatial cognition than language, including short-\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=3488, end_char_idx=6867, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='ff2e8b69-a97d-4049-9293-e2564c6ae1f8', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '11', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='bd56edee-270c-4939-a3b7-215e08ee40c7', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '11', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='489c015df408c47de3f313d78cdb8b65504e039f8a1c9c80343cbf967204083a'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='f546cfeb-4967-42bc-b964-e47be5f72a0d', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='44b96feab046f96afeffa64d9f1c9925d02dc5ef9189d94b6aa4cf5f1913f3b1'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='fb61973a-5a21-457a-a1c2-36a04cb94945', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='61b17adb5633d909808beec3a6c124c3b8b02e9074d99e0391bf464798e72dd4')}, text='13 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nterm memory (e.g. Bellugi, Marks, Bihrle, & Sabo, 1988;\\nJarrold, Baddeley, & Hewes, in press; Vicari, Brizzolara,Carlesimo, Pezzini, & Volterra, 1996; Wang & Bellugi,1994). Do these children encounter undue diﬃculty inlearning novel information such as unfamiliar faces andnew spatial routes? In terms of faces, the answer isprobably ‘‘no’’, as face processing in individuals withWilliams syndrome is considered to be relatively sparedin comparison with other aspects of visuospatial cog-nition (e.g. Karmiloﬀ-Smith, Klima, Bellugi, Grant, &Baron-Cohen, 1995). However, their abilities to learnnew spatial patterns are certainly impaired, but it is tooearly to conclude whether this long-term learning deﬁcitis speciﬁc to the visuospatial domain (Vicari et al., 1996).Thus, the ﬁndings to date are encouraging but incom-plete.\\nThe Central Executive\\nMany diﬀerent functions have been attributed to the\\nﬂexible but limited resource of the central executivecomponent of working memory. One general class offunctions relate to its putative regulatory and controlactivities: the central executive has been suggested to beresponsible for controlling the ﬂow of informationthrough working memory, for the retrieval of materialfrom more permanent long-term memory systems, andalso possibly for the control of action, planning, andgoal-directed behaviour (Baddeley, 1986). A second classof function is provided by speciﬁc strategies and special-ised types of computation ascribed to the executive: theseinclude retrieval strategies (Baddeley & Hitch, 1977,1993), logical reasoning (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974), andmental arithmetic (Hitch, 1980). Finally, some views ofthe central executive attribute to it both storage andprocessing functions that are fuelled by a limited resource(e.g. Case, Kurland, & Goldberg, 1982; Daneman &Carpenter, 1980, 1983; Just & Carpenter, 1992).\\nDevelopmental changes and disorders in the higher-\\nlevel functions of the central executive, related to plan-ning and goal-directed behaviour, have recently beenreviewed by Pennington and Ozonoﬀ (1996). The presentreview, in contrast, focuses on providing a developmentalanalysis of the ‘‘storage and processing’’ functions of thecentral executive. One inﬂuential research group hasprovided a systematic analysis of central executive func-tion using tasks that impose combined storage andprocessing loads on the individual, both independently ofthe working memory model of Baddeley and Hitch(1974). Daneman and Carpenter (1980) used the term‘‘working memory’’ to refer to a capacity-limited systemin which the resource burdens imposed by processinginformation and storing it are shared; this limitedresource is now termed ‘‘activation’’ (Just & Carpenter,1992). The crucial point is that if the amount of activationthat an individual has available is exceeded by thedemands of a task, there will be a trade-oﬀ betweenstorage and processing; as storage needs increase, therewill be less activation available to support processing,and vice versa. Many studies of adults have shown thatthere are substantial individual diﬀerences in activationlevels, as indexed by complex working memory tasks thatimpose combined processing and storage demands (see\\nDaneman & Merikle, 1996, for recent review and meta-analysis). Typical examples of complex working memorytasks are reading and listening span, in which anindividual has to process incoming information (eitherreading or listening to sentences, according to the versionof the task) at the same time as retaining the sequence ofthe ﬁnal words of the preceding sentences (Daneman &Carpenter, 1980). Another complex working memorytask is backward digit span, in which the task is to recalla digit sequence in backward order. Each of these tasksclearly require both storage and transformation ofmaterial. Importantly, individual diﬀerences in workingmemory (i.e. central executive) capacity indexed by suchtasks appear to be directly related to abilities to com-prehend and manipulate language. Thus, it appears thatworking memory capacity may have a direct impact onan individual’s everyday life.\\nPerformance on complex working memory span tasks\\nimproves during childhood.

Data from Siegel (1994),summarised in Fig. 4, show a regular increase in listeningspan between 6 and 15 years of age.\\nOne account of the changes in cognitive functioning\\nunderpinning the improvements in working memory spanover the childhood years is provided by a neo-Piagetiancharacterisation of limited M capacity introduced by\\nPascual-Leone (1970) and developed by Case et al. (1982).According to the more cognitive account advanced byCase et al., the total processing space available to anindividual can be ﬂexibly deployed as either processing orstorage space. The suggestion is that total storage spaceremains constant over development, but that the op-erational eﬃciency of an individual—at executing strate-gies and processing incoming information, for example—increases, releasing storage space. The task employed byCase et al. to explore this theory was counting span, inwhich children counted the number of objects in aparticular display, and then attempted to recall in correctserial order the number of objects in the precedingdisplays. Operational eﬃciency was assessed by mea-suring the amount of time it took the child to repeat aword they had just heard. Using these techniques, Case etal. provided evidence for a linear relationship betweenoperational eﬃciency and memory span in children agedbetween 2 and 6 years; as speed of repetition increased sodid memory span, consistent with the view that withincreasingage the processing demandsdiminish, releasingstorage space. In a further study, Case et al. also foundthat once diﬀerences in operational eﬃciency were con-trolled across children and adults (by requiring adults tocount in an unfamiliar language), span diﬀerences dis-appeared. This, they argued, ﬁts well with the notion of aconstant limit to processing space across all ages. In-dependent evidence that counting span provides ameasure of working memory capacity that has directimpact on everyday cognitive activities is provided byYuill, Oakhill, and Parkin (1989), who found thatchildren with poor reading comprehension abilities haddeﬁcits in counting span. Thus in children as well as inadults, these capacity limitations appear to constraincomplex comprehension processes.\\nThe majority of research on complex working memory\\ntasksfocuses on language processing and comprehension,\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=3632, end_char_idx=6609, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='9cca2a25-03e2-420d-85f1-2decec91439f', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '12', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3355ef5d-e011-402f-a2ae-9d3294b1e5cf', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '12', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='5f0a0c45c2f42f5b50417cc3c6a5f1d529d77cb8ec49ee277962424c30f68b0d'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='fb61973a-5a21-457a-a1c2-36a04cb94945', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '11', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='279cae5459c4116a7abb79af9485f832a4d24d3b691c23065fd1450b48f542e8'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c1a4f61a-829f-4fe2-983d-2f67237e674c', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='f0e11e9880d819b05e38a5468517de6fc53aef98a760ab6a9ce52be4f294fc40')}, text='14 S. E. GATHERCOLE\\nFigure 4. Mean number of items correct on complex working memory task, as a\\nfunction of age group. Based on data from Siegel (1994).\\nand this raises some important issues concerning theor-\\netical interpretation of the data. One such issue is whethercomplex working memory measures and immediateverbal memory span tasks both simply tap the phono-logical loop. This can clearly be ruled out on severalgrounds.First,Hitch,Halliday,andLittler(1989)showedthat the contributions of Case et al.’s measure ofoperational eﬃciency, item identiﬁcation time, and thephonological loop to immediate memory span can bedissociated experimentally (although see Kail & Park,1994, for diﬀerent conclusions based on a correlationalapproach). Second, Oakhill, Yuill, and Parkin (1986)failed to ﬁnd any diﬀerences between children or goodand poor reading comprehension abilities on measures ofsimple memory span, although working memory spandeﬁcits have been found in the poor comprehensiongroup (Yuill et al., 1989). Third, complex workingmemory measures show consistently higher associationswith language comprehension than do simple memoryspan measures (Daneman & Merikle, 1996). Fourth,complex and simple span tasks show dissociable ageingeﬀects in adulthood: complex span diminishes from earlyto late adulthood, whereas simple span is maintained(Siegel, 1994). Finally, Morra (1994) administered a wide\\nrange of both complex and simple working memory tasksto a large sample of children, and found that individualvariability in the complex tasks such as counting spanand backward digit span was relatively independent ofvariability in simple memory span across children. Thus,complex and simple memory span appear to havedissociable origins within short-term working memory.\\nA further issue, which cannot be answered so readily, is\\nwhether complex memory span tasks represent a com-ponent of the central executive that is highly specialisedfor the analysis of language rather than a general purposeprocessing system. Daneman and Merikle (1996) proposethat the equivalent degree of association betweenmeasures of language comprehension and both verbaland ‘‘math’’-based (e.g. counting span) complex spanmeasures rules out an account of the links in terms of aprocessing system speciﬁc to the storage and manipu-lation of verbal material. This interpretation is not,however, unproblematic as counting, too, is a verballymediated task.

Whether the actual capacity of thesystem increases or not cannot be determined unambig-uously: one possibility is that the total resource (oramount of activation, in Just & Carpenter’s 1992 terms)increases developmentally; another possibility is thatprocessing demands diminish, thereby allowing the sys-tem to achieve more on a resource limitation that remainsconstant across time (Case et al., 1982). An equallyimportant issue is what impact individual and devel-opmental diﬀerences in the capacity of the centralexecutive have for everyday cognitive activities. Onepossibility is that a child with poor working memorycapacity will experience learning disabilities of a non-speciﬁc nature, and that executive capacity limitationsmay be particularly inﬂuential in preventing childrenwith more speciﬁc learning disabilities such as dyslexiafrom developing alternative strategies to support theirlearning (Swanson, 1993).\\nLong-term Memory\\nWe have seen above that children, like adults, have\\nwell-marked capacities to retain and manipulate manydiﬀerent types of information in short-term memory, andthat diﬀerences in these capacities may have directconsequences for the individual’s child’s abilities to learnin many diﬀerent ways. So, there appear to be importantlinksbetweenshort-termmemoryandlong-termlearning.But what about children’s long-term memory? The term‘‘long-term memory’’ is used here to refer to memory forevents that occurred hours, days, months, and years ago.What distinguishes long-term memory used in this wayfrom learning is that it refers not to memory for repeatedevents, but instead for single distant episodes. This typeof memory is almost always incomplete, and has nottypically been associated with any conscious attempt to‘‘learn’’.\\nA number of distinct memory systems or processes\\nappear to support long-term memory for previous events,although the diﬀerent components and their relationshipto one another are generally less well understood than isthe case for short-term memory. One important dis-tinction, made originally by Tulving (1972), is betweensemantic and episodic memory. The term semanticmemory refers to the near-permanent knowledge that wehave about the world—for example, our understandingof the meaning of individual words, our knowledge of ournames, and of facts. Semantic memory is characterised bya lack of recollection about the speciﬁc occasions onwhich the semantic knowledge was established; these arethings that we just ‘‘know’’. Episodic memory, on theother hand, refers to our memories for speciﬁc episodespreviously experienced; our memories for such events areoften accompanied by the phenomenal experience ofrecollective experience (Tulving, 1983).\\nThe principal focus of this part of the review is on the\\naspect of long-term memory that Tulving characterisedas ‘‘episodic’’. Further distinctions are necessary to\\ncharacterise the salient features of development of long-term memory. For the present purposes, the term episodicmemory will be reserved for memory for events that tookplace relatively recently in time—earlier this morning,yesterday, and maybe even last week. Over these (inlifetime terms) relatively small timescales, we are rathergoodatbeingabletoretrieveinformationaboutmundaneaspects of our lives, such as the food we ate at a particularmeal, where we parked the car, and who we stood with inthe elevator. The majority of experimental studies oflong-term memory take place over such relatively shortperiods, but typically lack much of the self-involvementof long-term, personally salient, episodic memories.Typical episodic memory paradigms involve participantsseeing or hearing lists of words, listening to a story, orseeing an enactment of an event in which they play norole. As a consequence, episodic memory as tested in theexperimental laboratory is characterised by low self-reference (the participant is usually a passive observer),and rarely yields a personal interpretation in the par-ticipant (Conway, 1990, 1996).\\nIn everyday life, of course, speciﬁc events are remem-\\nbered over much longer periods, up to years and decades.Thus, we can often recall some features of salient eventsthat took place a long time ago, such as moving house, aparticularly impactful conversation with a colleague, awedding, or a car accident.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4644, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='11231992-c6c2-4124-af49-dbe718b60399', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '13', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='682443d3-6154-4c60-9b76-f12410e0115f', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '13', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='53816b60f1de50c477e93265e5eb650560768b25ec79cdcd9ec3bf8a5f6def00'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c1a4f61a-829f-4fe2-983d-2f67237e674c', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '13', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='16e6a19eae0b00c2fd9214e4327fa9cb79ab064ff74325dc605f563649d4507e'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='38347c3e-1817-4537-8add-e4106fcd2c78', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='62a695128668c84e9f6a34153a1f25dfb70426fa25cddada1e4f2bcbe8730dff')}, text='As a consequence, episodic memory as tested in theexperimental laboratory is characterised by low self-reference (the participant is usually a passive observer),and rarely yields a personal interpretation in the par-ticipant (Conway, 1990, 1996).\\nIn everyday life, of course, speciﬁc events are remem-\\nbered over much longer periods, up to years and decades.Thus, we can often recall some features of salient eventsthat took place a long time ago, such as moving house, aparticularly impactful conversation with a colleague, awedding, or a car accident. Our memories of such eventsis almost always incomplete, in that we remember muchless material than we would if the event had taken placeearlier today. Some important information, however,endures over long periods of time, and allows us toreminisce. This type of remembering of genuine events,which can take place over many years, is termed ‘‘auto-biographical memory’’. Autobiographical memory ishigh in self-reference, and frequently accompanied by apersonal interpretation, in contrast to laboratory-testedepisodic memory described above (Conway, 1990, 1996).There appear to be at least three highly signiﬁcant aspectsof autobiographical memory knowledge: speciﬁc events,general classes of events, and lifetime periods, which areorganised hierarchically (Conway, 1990). These diﬀerentsources of knowledge are combined at ‘‘remembering’’ toconstruct the dynamic representations of speciﬁc eventsthat correspond to our phenomenal experience of beingabletoremembera distantevent(Conway,1996; Conway& Rubin, 1993; Neisser, 1962).\\nThe past decade or so has seen a surge in interest in the\\ndevelopment during childhood of both episodic memoryand autobiographical memory, motivated both by theor-etical concerns and by the increasing need to gauge thevalidity of testimony by children in the courtroom incases relating to child abuse.

One of themajor diﬃculties in this area is that for psycholegalpurposes we need to understand constraints on children’sautobiographical memory: memory for events in whichthe child was centrally involved and which often evoke ahighly emotional response.

E. GATHERCOLE\\nmajority of research on this topic has employed labora-\\ntory-based paradigms, which allow greater experimentalrigour but which have the characteristics of low self-reference and personal interpretation that clearly identifythem as assessing episodic rather than autobiographicalmemory. Thus, the impact of many ﬁndings from thelaboratory for the development of autobiographicalmemory is still largely unknown.\\nThe Development of Autobiographical Memory\\nOne extremely important feature of autobiographical\\nmemory, which establishes that there are major de-velopmental changes in this type of remembering, is thephenomenon known as ‘‘ childhood amnesia’’. This termrefers to the fact, ﬁrst reported by Henri and Henri in1897 (see Nelson, 1993a), that it is extremely unusual foran individual to be able to retrieve memories about eventsthat took place before 2 years of age, and that memoriesfor the period between about 2 and 5 years are relativelyinfrequent. In a recent inﬂuential re-evaluation of child-hood amnesia, Pillemer and White (1989) obtained anaverage age of the earliest retrieved memory as 3 ±5 years,\\nwith a range from 2 to 8 years for the earliest memoryacross individuals.\\nThis scarcity of memories for events in the earliest\\nyears of life can be diﬃcult to interpret. In most cases, itis not possible to validate the date of origin of the earliestmemories, nor to rule out the possibility that an in-dividual actually remembers later descriptions by othersof the key event, or other external prompts such asphotographs. A number of studies have, however, foundclear evidence of the usual childhood amnesia phenom-enon when memories for events were sampled that had aknown date of occurrence, such as the birth of a sibling(Sheingold & Tenney, 1982; Usher & Neisser, 1993) andevents of national importance (Winograd & Killinger,1983). Also, dependence on memories for others re-counting stories of early childhood or on other externalsources of support is clearly insuﬃcient to explain themarkeddistributionofthe memoriesoverearlychildhoodin itself, with the absolute absence of memories for eventsprior to 2 years of age. Thus, childhood amnesia appearsto represent a valid phenomenon.\\nA number of memory-based accounts of childhood\\namnesia have been advanced. One possibility that hasnow been discounted is that the phenomenon is simply afunction of forgetting, with the most distant memories ofone’s life more subject to forgetting than subsequentones. It has been ruled out both by observations that theperiod of childhood amnesia does not ‘‘spread’’ withincreasing age of the rememberer, and by demonstrationsof the failure of mathematical models of forgetting topredict the dearth of memories prior to 5 years of age(Wetzler & Sweeney, 1986).\\nAnother general account of childhood amnesia is that\\nadults’ failures to retrieve memories from early childhoodand infancy reﬂects not the absence of memory records ortraces, but their inaccessibility. As discussed earlier,remembering memories of personal events that occurredmany years ago is not simply a passive act of retrieval, butis instead a reconstructive process in which diﬀerent typesof knowledge about the structure of events and one’s lifeis applied to incomplete memory traces to generate a\\nstable representation (Conway, 1996; Neisser, 1962).Neisser suggested that the adult ‘‘schemas’’ applied atretrieval will fail to make sense of the fragments availablefor early childhood events, and that this ‘‘schema-mismatch’’ is the source of childhood amnesia. A moredetailed version of this account is considered later in thissection.\\nOther more speciﬁc accounts of the changes in\\nchildren’s memories during the early part of life and theways in which these changes may contribute to childhoodamnesia have been advanced in recent years. An in-ﬂuential research team headed by Nelson have proposedthat autobiographical memories are not formed duringthe childhood amnesia period, and that is why they arenot subsequently available for retrieval in childhood(Nelson & Gruendel, 1981).

An in-ﬂuential research team headed by Nelson have proposedthat autobiographical memories are not formed duringthe childhood amnesia period, and that is why they arenot subsequently available for retrieval in childhood(Nelson & Gruendel, 1981). Analyses of children’s mem-ories for events within this critical period of later infancyand the preschool years have yielded mixed results withrespect to this hypothesis. There is certainly someevidence that young children are much better at des-cribing the features of familiar, repeated events such asgoing to nursery and having lunch at MacDonalds thanat recalling details of speciﬁc incidents that occurred justonce (Hudson, 1986; Hudson & Nelson, 1986; Nelson,1978; Nelson & Gruendel, 1981; Nelson & Ross, 1980).Such ﬁndings led to the proposal that, during the earlyyears of life, children incorporate their ongoing experi-ences into frames of knowledge for familiar events or‘‘scripts’’, such as going to nursery and eating atMacDonalds, but do not (unlike older children andadults) retain details of speciﬁc incidents. By this account,information about speciﬁc details of events that departfrom the routine are only retained in an emergingautobiographical memory system by about 4 years of age,when the child has developed an extensive repertoire ofgeneric knowledge about the event structure of their life.Nelson (1993a, b) argues that such an evolving system isan eﬃcient use of the child’s cognitive resources, as beforesuch generic knowledge has been accumulated, it is notpossible for children to judge what is and what is notunusual, and therefore they cannot eﬀectively judge whatfeatures of an episode to store in memory.\\nThe problem for the simple view, that children do not\\nhave detailed autobiographical memories for speciﬁc in-cidents during the period of childhood amnesia, is thatit is at odds with a considerable amount of other evidence.Nelson’s (1989) own transcripts and analysis of thebedtime talk of an infant Emily between the ages of 19and 37 months provides substantial evidence that, at leastover short timescales of a day or less, Emily was able torecall many detailed features of the day’s activities. Andon a larger timescale, Fivush and Hamond (1990) foundthat at 2 ±5 years, many children had memories of events\\nthat took place 6 months previously and that at 4 years,some children were able to recall events from 2 yearsof age.\\nTo account for such ﬁndings, Nelson (1993a, b) pro-\\nposed that children’s early memories of recent events areserved not by autobiographical memory, but by a short-term holding system for recent events—episodic memory.Thus, Emily’s crib talk reﬂects use of this system.

Nelson suggests that this might beachieved by the reinstatement of previous event contexts,which appears to prolong very substantially the amountof time that information can be preserved in episodicmemory even in young infants. Several studies have nowdemonstrated that reinstatement, or the re-presentationof an earlier event some time after its initial occurrence,will eﬀectively extend a child’s memory for that event(Bauer, Hertsgaard, & Wewarka, 1995; Boller, Rovee-Collier, Gulya, & Prete, 1996; Fivush & Hamond, 1989;Rovee-Collier, Sullivan, Enright, Lucas, & Fagen, 1980).\\nNelson’s (1993a, b) views of the changes that take place\\nin the types of memory knowledge or systems available tosupport remembering of distant events are summarisedschematically in Fig. 5. In the pre-autobiographical stagethat characterises the infancy and preschool period,memory is supported by two systems, episodic memoryand generic memory. Repeated encounters with similarevents allow access to the generic memory system.Subsequently, in the ‘‘post-autobiographical system’’,autobiographical memory emerges and interacts withsemantic, generic, and episodic memory to provide adynamic and ﬂexible system for remembering both recentand distant events. Why, though, does autobiographicalmemory emerge when it does?\\nUsing a social-interactional framework, Fivush,\\nNelson, and colleagues suggest that autobiographicalmemory emerges because children learn to talk abouttheir memories and learn how to formulate memories asnarratives. Fivush, Haden, and Reese (1996) provide\\nevidence that although adults engage children as youngas 2 years and below in conversations involvingreminiscence of shared events, the young child makeslittle substantive contribution to the collective activity ofremembering, even when cued. By 4 years of age,however, the typical child shows considerable com-petence in talking within the narrative structure ap-propriate for shared reminiscence (Fivush, Haden, &Adam, 1995). Fivush et al. (1996) identify two possiblecontributors to this emerging competence. First, adultsgradually introduce children to richer and more complexways of talking about earlier events. Second, the child’sincreasing facility at language provides the opportunityfor restructuring and understanding past experiences in away that more closely approximates to the adult narrativeform. Via these and other processes, it is proposed that acoherent and organised autobiographical memory systemcan eventually be developed and used from 4 yearsonwards, with increasing eﬀectiveness for supportingmemory for distant events.\\nIn an important test of whether narrative coherence in\\ntalking about memories heralds the end of childhoodamnesia, Pillemer, Picariello, and Pruett (1994) provideda detailed investigation of whether the degree of narrativestructuring of young children’s memory for a recentautobiographical event predicts the likelihood of recall ofthe same event 7 years later.

As a result, the children were evacuatedfrom the building, following the emergency procedure.Pillemer et al. tested the children’s memories for thisexciting event 2 weeks later and then again after a delay of7 years. The most interesting aspect of the ﬁndings relatedto the subdivision of the children as either 3 or 4 years atthe time of the original event, two age groups whichprobably straddle the boundary to the childhood amnesiaperiod. Seven years later, 57% of the older groupproduced either an intact or fragmentary memory of theevent, whereas only 18% of the younger group were ableto do so. Similarly, whereas 86% of the older groupselected the correct location of classroom from whichthey were evacuated in a forced-choice test, the youngerchildren performed at chance level on this measure. Thusdespite the very long period intervening between theevent and the later unexpected memory test, the 1-yearage diﬀerence at original experience between the youngerand older preschool children had powerful consequencesfor the much later memory of this real-life event.\\nPillemer et al. (1994) propose that these ﬁndings align\\nreadily with the ‘‘cognitive developmental’’ approach tochildhood amnesia (Pillemer, 1992; Pillemer & White,1989; Usher & Neisser, 1993), according to which thepossibility and quality of later recall is dependent uponthe degree of correspondence between the cognitivemechanisms in place at the time of experiencing theoriginal event and attempting to recollect it. Pillemer etal. suggest that the principal constraining factor atoriginal experience was the degree of causal understand-ing of the narrative structure of the event, with the olderchildren showing superior understanding of the relation-ship of the diﬀerent components of the event to oneanother. So the greater the narrative coherence at thetime, the more organised the resulting memory trace andthe closer the match with the narrative schemas applied tointerpret the incomplete memory traces many years later.\\nA rather diﬀerent perspective on the development of\\nautobiographical memory has recently been advanced byHowe and Courage (1997). They propose that auto-biographical memory is present typically by 2 years ofage, considerably earlier than Nelson’s (1993a, b) es-timate of 4 years. According to Howe and Courage,autobiographical memory is present as soon as the‘‘cognitive self’’, or the awareness of oneself as havingspeciﬁc cognitive capacities, emerges at between 18 and24 months. A key feature of this account is that there is nodevelopmental discontinuity in memory systems priorand subsequent to the emergence of autobiographicalmemory. Rather, basic memory systems are in place fromearly infancy, and the organising structure of the cog-nitive self acts upon these to generate autobiographicalmemories. Increases in the accuracy of autobiographicalmemory subsequent to 2 years are attributed to a varietyof developmental changes including increased linguisticproﬁciency and narrative knowledge, and memorystorage capacity.\\nIn addition to these general developmental factors that\\nappear to govern the quality and quantity of auto-biographical memories in childhood, emotional experi-ence appears to play a critical role in the establishment ofenduring autobiographical memories at this stage. Thedegreeoftrauma associatedwithapersonallyexperienced\\nevent has a substantial impact on a young child’ssubsequent memories. Ornstein (1995) found superiorrecall in children of experiencing an unpleasant medicalprocedure than of a routine visit to a doctor. Similarly,Hamond and Fivush (1990) obtained recall protocolsfrom young children for their experience of HurricaneAndrew; these contained over twice the degree of detailas did a comparable group of children’s recall of a familytrip to Disneyworld. These and other ﬁndings indicatethat, in children as in adults, the degree of personalinvolvement and emotional experience accompanying anevent are important determinants of its memorability(Conway, 1995).\\nThe evidence presented in this section attests to major\\ndevelopmental changes in the organisation of autobio-graphical memory in the early childhood years.

Theoristsdisagree according to whether the changes over theseyears reﬂect the initial absence and then eventual emerg-ence of an autobiographical memory system (Nelson,1993a, b) or gradual changes to the ways in which thechild organises his or her experience (Howe & Courage,1997; Usher & Neisser, 1993). Either way, the conse-quences for the amount and coherence of materialremembered from earlier incidents is clearly subject toenormous change during the period extending frominfancy to the preschool years.\\nOne concern is that the conclusion that preschoolers’\\nmemories are relatively lacking in both detail andcoherence nonetheless stands in direct conﬂict with theviews of parents and carers that, as early as 2 years of age,children produce complex and detailed narrativeaccounts of prior events. Could it simply be that lack ofdetail and coherence of the memories is a product of themethodologies used for obtaining memory protocols ofyoung children, which typically involve an unfamiliarperson asking the child to remember a particular event? Itis at least possible that a close family member would bemore successful in eliciting more ‘‘mature’’ memoriesfrom 2- and 3-year-old children. If this was found to bethe case, the clear implication would be that the com-plexity of young children’s accounts of previous eventsmay be limited not by long-term memory but by lack ofdevelopment of social narrative skills to guide theirinteractions with strangers.\\nThe Development of Episodic Memory\\nThe body of evidence reviewed above identiﬁes im-\\nportant developments in the child’s abilities over thepreschool period to remember speciﬁc past events and toorganise recall of those events.

Anyonewho has had regular close contact with children betweenbirth and 2 years of age will know that even at these veryyoung ages, children frequently demonstrate surprisingand impressive abilities to remember events which haveoften only been experienced on a single occasion. In thesection below, some recent research designed to addressthis issue is outlined.\\nNonverbal memory in infancy and early childhood .\\nOne inﬂuential group has conducted pioneering studiesof children’s memories for single distant events experi-enced as infants and toddlers, and has concluded fromtheir studies that these memory abilities are served by thesame memory system that contributes to remembering inolder children and adults (e.g., Bauer & Mandler, 1989;Meltzoﬀ, 1988). These researchers used a nonverbalmethod for assessing the memories of very young andlargely preverbal children, known as the elicited imitationparadigm. In this paradigm, the child observes theexperimenter using props to model a single action or anaction sequence. Examples of action sequences are ‘‘putFozzy bear to bed’’ and ‘‘make a windmill’’ (Bauer et al.,1995). The props are then given to the child, who isencouraged to imitate the action. The degree of cor-respondence between the child’s sequences of actionswith the props and the original modelled sequence is thenscored, providing a measure of the extent to which thechild remembered the experimenter’s actions. Typically,the child’s ‘‘recall’’ is sampled after a delay that mayrange from hours to years.\\nThis paradigm has yielded clear evidence that infants\\nand toddlers do retain a considerable amount of in-formation about earlier events. At 14 months of age,recall can survive a delay of 1 week (Meltzoﬀ, 1988), andsome 13-month-old children can remember multi-stepsequences up to 6 weeks later. Even more impressively,recollection of action sequences witnessed on a singleoccasion only has been found to persist for 8 to 12 monthsin 2-year old children (Bauer, Hertsgaard, & Dow, 1994;McDonough & Mandler, 1994).\\nYoung children’s performance on the elicited imitation\\nparadigm is sensitive to at least two important factors.First, the amount of information remembered by thechild is increased and the period of time over which it isretained is prolonged if the child passively witnesses theoriginal event in full or in part after a considerable delay.This eﬀect of reinstatement has now been demonstratedon many occasions (Fivush, 1984; Hudson, 1986, 1990;Sheﬃeld & Hudson, 1994), and remarkably was found byBauer et al. (1995) to operate even when the reinstatementconsists simply of a verbal reminder to 15-month-olds ofthe action sequence accompanied by the props, and notby full re-enactment of the sequence. As noted earlier,similar beneﬁts of reinstatement have also been found inconditioned learning by very young infants (Boller et al.,1996; Hill, Borovsky, & Rovee-Collier, 1988; Rovee-Collier & Fagen, 1981); reinstatement may be one of the\\nmechanisms by which information is transferred from arelatively fragile (in terms of temporal duration, at least)memory holding system into a more durable memoryreserve.\\nA second factor inﬂuencing recall in the event memory\\ntask is the degree to which the component actions in themodelled action sequence are constrained or enabled byone another.

A close look at individual studies using thisapproach, however, reveals substantial inconsistencies inﬁndings. For example, McDonough and Mandler (1994)found that 2-year-olds returning to the laboratory after a1-year delay showed evidence of recalling a familiarmodelled action (of feeding Teddy with a schematicbottle) but not of remembering sequences of unfamiliaractions. In contrast, Bauer et al. (1994) found thattoddlers of a similar age recalled novel event sequences(such as ‘‘make a rattle’’), but not familiar sequences(‘‘feeding Teddy’’), 8 months later. Why opposite eﬀectsshould be found across the two studies is as yet unclear.Furthermore, Boyer, Barron, and Farrar (1994) failed toobtain any evidence, in either verbal protocols or non-verbal imitation, of memory in 2-year-old children of anactivity (making PlayDoh spaghetti) learned over a yearpreviously. This result is clearly at odds with otherﬁndings.

In other words, Nelson’s suggestionwas that young children are drawing upon a primitivelearning system in the elicited imitation paradigm, ratherthan the episodic or autobiographical memory systemsthat she considers to support memory in preschool andolder children (Nelson, 1993a).\\nIt is relevant at this point to note that in the elicited\\nimitation task, the child passively witnesses the modellingof fairly arbitrary action sequences. This passive natureof the to-be-remembered episode may in itself contributeto a substantial underestimation of the capacities ofyoung children to remember previous events. It is alreadyknown that active participation in an event enhanceschildren’s recall (Rudy & Goodman, 1991) and this maybe because the event, by virtue of its high self-referenceand personal relevance, is represented in autobiographi-cal rather than episodic memory (Conway, 1990, 1996).The paradigms described in the previous section, in whichchildren were later asked to recall events in which theyplayed an integral role, such as evacuating a building inan emergency (Pillemer et al., 1994), or a visit to anarchaeological museum (Hudson & Fivush, 1991), aresimilarly meaningful to the child. In contrast, the neutralaction sequences employed in the elicited imitation task,modelled by another, will be much lower in self-relevanceto the children, and are unlikely to elicit a personalinterpretation. Thus the elicited imitation paradigm andmemory tasks that require recall of real-life episodes maydraw upon fundamentally diﬀerent memory systems. Forthis reason alone, direct comparison of long-term mem-oryabilitiesofvery youngandolderchildren,confoundedas they are both by paradigm and age of the child at test,is probably neither possible nor appropriate.\\nAlthough the studies of long-term memory in very\\nyoung children reviewed above may not provide a con-vincing demonstration that the same memory systemsare in place across the full range of the childhood yearsfrom infancy onwards, the ﬁndings are nonetheless im-portant. They securely establish that young children cansometimes retain information from speciﬁc episodes oververy long periods of time. We are, however, a long wayfrom being able to predict in advance what particularinformation a child of a particular age is likely to retainover diﬀerent periods of time: this is highly dependent onmany detailed aspects of the nature of the memory event,as well as known sources of individual diﬀerences such asgender, parental style of communication, and languageability (Fivush et al., 1996; Nelson, 1993a, b; Reese,Haden, & Fivush, 1993).\\nEyewitness testimony . The need to understand the\\nquality of children’s memory for distant events hasbecome imperative in recent years as a consequence ofincreasing dependence on testimony provided by childwitnesses in the courtroom in cases relating to childabuse, domestic violence, and crime in schools. Appro-priate interpretation of such evidence clearly requiresevaluation of the reliability of children’s memory, and ofthe developmental changes that occur.

Consistentwith the ﬁndings of other laboratory studies and investi-gations of children’s autobiographical memories re-viewed above, it has been demonstrated on manyoccasions that in these tasks young children (and es-pecially preschool children) recall considerably less of thetarget events than either older children or adults (e.g.Cohen & Harnick, 1980; King & Yuille, 1987; Oates &Shrimpton, 1991; Ornstein, Gordon, & Larus, 1992).The implication is that young children have relativelyimpoverished memory representations of events, possiblyarising from poor understanding of the causal structureof the events (Pillemer et al., 1994).\\nAdults’ memory for witnessed events is of course also\\nfallible, and has been shown on many occasions to beliable to distortion by misleading post-event information(e.g. Loftus, 1979). Using the eyewitness testimonyparadigm developed by Loftus, in which a memory eventis followed by some ‘‘questions’’ that incorporate in-accurate information, it has been found that youngchildren (of about 6 years and below) are even morevulnerable to distortion following exposure to misleadinginformation about the memory event than are olderchildren and adults. For example, Ceci, Ross, and Toglia(1987) presented to children a story about a girl who hada stomachache from eating her breakfast too fast.Subsequently, the children were asked a biased question:‘‘Do you remember the story about Loren ,the girl who had\\na headache because she ate her cereal too fast ?’’. Still later,\\nthe children were given a forced-choice recognition taskinvolving two pictures; in one, Loren was eating hercereal and in the other (incorrect one), she had aheadache. In this experiment, the probability of makingcorrect recognition judgements was lower for such biasedthan unbiased information, and the extent of the biasingdecrement decreased regularly from the younger (3–4years) to the older (10–12 years) children. In a recentreview, Ceci and Bruck (1993) found such evidence ofincreased suggestibility to misleading information inyounger children in 88% of such eyewitness testimonystudies. According to Ceci (1995, p. 155, original italics),‘‘there arereliable age diﬀerence in suggestibility, with\\npreschool children’s reports being more readily impededby the presence of erroneous suggestions by an inter-viewer than older children’s reports’’.\\nThe implication of these ﬁndings is that the integrity of\\nyoung children’s memories for real-life events is unlikelyto survive detailed questioning in and out of the court-room. Ceci, Huﬀman, and Smith (1994) attempted tosimulate this by asking children to think, repeatedly overa 10-week period, about both real events and events thatnever happened. For example, a false event could be cuedby the interviewer saying to the child ‘‘ Think real hard ,\\nand tell me if this ever happened to you .Can you ever\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=3126, end_char_idx=6916, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='39115524-cdb9-45b3-b1db-7fe31360d82d', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='26b35a46-c67e-4cd4-b424-d7424bb57e32', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='4fbe58161150b7a76b6a9dc5a140df3816547ff4ebfccbfcbfafc84d90affac4'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='77a6ebac-5719-48ea-a0c9-c8da34bf78b2', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '18', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='4a7e55a449994373fa72f9b0baf76586792c58dfe8d6895daa5284f61277f068'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='bbe140b0-f91e-4ef3-beb4-fbae05d720b3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='1eb351567603a2c294b6e7ab466a20a4a2664433c22a1ea313a732a393078794')}, text='21 DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY\\nremember going to hospital with a mousetrap on your\\nﬁnger?’’. Over the period of the study, 58% of preschool\\nchildren produced false narratives and at least one falseevent description, and a quarter of the children respondedwith ‘‘memories’’ to the majority of the ﬁctionalisedevent descriptions. So, mere exposure to adults askingyou about events that did not take place is clearlysuﬃcient under some circumstances to yield false mem-ories. Possibly most troubling of all, Ceci et al. videotapedthe children in this experiment being given a forensic-styleinterview about both real and false events, and showedthe tapes to psychologists specialising in children’stestimony. These professionals were no better thanchance at discriminating children’s recounting of trueover false memories.\\nThe evidence reviewed so far indicates that young\\nchildren have both relatively poor event memory andhigh suggestibility to misleading information. For adetailed analysis of the roots of this comparatively lowreliability of preschoolers’ memories, it is useful toconsider possible mechanisms for suggestibility eﬀects.Loftus, Schooler, and Wagenaar (1985) suggested thatpost-event information (such as a biasing question) maydestructively update the original memory trace, replacingthe original target information with the later biasinginformation. Quite plausibly, it could be argued that thelower levels of organisation and integration of infor-mation within the original memory trace in youngerchildren might be particularly low in resistance to suchupdating. Another mechanism considered by Loftus et al.is that the subsequent biased material is retained in acoexisting memory with the original information, butthat possibly as a consequence of its more recent date itsuppresses access to incompatible material in the earliermemory trace, and hence leads to biasing errors. Toaccount for the greater degree of suggestibility of youngchildren via this mechanism, it would be necessary tomake the rather arbitrary assumption that the inhibitoryeﬀect of the later memory on access to the originalmemory trace is more severe in younger children.\\nThere are, however, a range of other possible mechan-\\nisms for memory suggestibility eﬀects that make muchless strong claims about the impact of later events onoriginal memory representations, and that may, in fact,all plausibly contribute to the observed developmentalchanges in degree of susceptibility to misleading in-formation. McCloskey and Zaragoza (1985; see alsoZaragoza & Lane, 1994) suggested that the later biasedinformation does not either distort or deny access to theoriginal memory information, but instead is used to ﬁll ingaps in incompletely speciﬁed memory traces. Thus invery young children, who we already know have par-ticularly poorly speciﬁed memories, the probability ofmisleading information being used in this way to com-plete earlier memories will be particularly high.\\nA related view is that the increased suggestibility of\\nyoung children reﬂects their response to the demandcharacteristics of the memory situation, in which thechild is provided with new information by the adultexperimenter, an authority ﬁgure (Poole & Lindsay,1995). Thus the child may assume that the post-eventsuggestions are valid and so consciously base theirresponses on the suggestions rather than the original, andpossibly conﬂicting, memories. In Ceci et al.’s (1994)\\nsimulated false memory situation, the child may simplyassume that if the experimenter thinks that he or she wentto hospital attached to a mousetrap, they must be right.Consistent with this compliance view, the impact ofbiasing post-event information on young children is nowknown to be reduced if its source is another child ratherthan an adult (Ceci, Leichtman, Putnick, & Nightingale,1993).\\nA further possibility is that the young child remembers\\nboth the critical detail of the original event and thecontent of the post-event suggestion (in the example ofthe Ceci et al. 1987 study, this would be the stomachacheand the headache), but is uncertain as to which detailoccurred in the original story. This represents a failure ofwhat has come to be known as source monitoring, or theability to discriminate between memories from diﬀerentsources. Young children have been found to make moreerrors than adults in discriminating between performedand imagined actions (Foley & Johnson, 1985; Foley,Johnson, & Raye, 1983; Lindsay, Johnson, & Kwon,1991), although these developmental diﬀerences in moni-toring do appear somewhat inconsistent across studies(e.g.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4589, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='bbe140b0-f91e-4ef3-beb4-fbae05d720b3', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='26b35a46-c67e-4cd4-b424-d7424bb57e32', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='4fbe58161150b7a76b6a9dc5a140df3816547ff4ebfccbfcbfafc84d90affac4'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='39115524-cdb9-45b3-b1db-7fe31360d82d', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='1c5f30a091a17281ce2048d17f041981a7a00ec0c0b999b61b1fd6493ed27717'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='8b40b41e-bb7b-4cae-bde9-76cd57e6271e', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='35d0e1cc28d1f1b0e05083503f38613bf2883800cb96e0e1f209058f8364abd0')}, text='A further possibility is that the young child remembers\\nboth the critical detail of the original event and thecontent of the post-event suggestion (in the example ofthe Ceci et al. 1987 study, this would be the stomachacheand the headache), but is uncertain as to which detailoccurred in the original story.

There is certainly direct evidence thatsource confusions in eyewitness testimony tasks aregreater in younger than older children (Ackil & Zaragoza,1995), lending further weight to this suggestion that veryyoung children are not necessarily unduly misled, butinstead are often unable to remember what detail wassupplied by what source.\\nThus although the vulnerability of preschool children\\nto misinformation after the memory event is widelyaccepted, the causes for the apparent memory distortionsare still being keenly debated. It certainly seems plausiblethat much of the apparent distortion of their memoriesdoes not necessarily reﬂect alterations in the originalmemory representation, but other factors such as com-pliance to the suggestions of adult authority ﬁgures, anduncertainty about the precise source of rememberedinformation. Practical implications follow from thisanalysis. In particular, incorporating source monitoringquestions (e.g. ‘‘ did you see that happen ,or did somebody\\ntell you that it happened ?’’) into interviews with child\\nwitnesses should lead to an increase in the reliability oftheir testimony (Poole & Lindsay, 1995).\\nOn the other hand, some of the models increasingly\\nused by professionals in their interactions with childwitnesses may be counter-productive. The use of dollsand props in interviews are widely believed to enhanceremembering in young children, and to compensate tosome degree for the linguistic limitations of the youngwitness. However, preschool children have recently beenshown to have diﬃculty in using dolls as representationsof themselves (DeLoache & Marzolf, 1995). Moreover,although the introduction of props at recall may elicitmore information, there is little gain in the amount ofaccurate recall (Salmon, Bidrose, & Pipe, 1995). The factthat children use dolls and props when allowed thereforeprovides no guarantee of more accurate memory as-sessment.\\nThe main conclusions to emerge from this brief review\\nof children’s eyewitness testimony, of relatively poor\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S0021963097001753  Published online by Cambridge University Press', start_char_idx=3827, end_char_idx=6763, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), TextNode(id_='8b40b41e-bb7b-4cae-bde9-76cd57e6271e', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='7ea1eb4f-3a88-446e-980a-b3cdbc643a0a', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'page_label': '20', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='b25199ab78f8131b71185be135211502b59023b828772f28096a944dddd6ecd8'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='bbe140b0-f91e-4ef3-beb4-fbae05d720b3', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'page_label': '19', 'file_name': 'the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/research_papers/the-development-of-memory.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 395145, 'creation_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_modified_date': '2024-01-27', 'last_accessed_date': '2024-01-27'}, hash='238b574d7ace63a0858b1e342f4f03205e83bfb597b11354d7099ff46263cc32'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='14e76362-fa24-49c8-9d20-5b126e74f0d5', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='980d25dabfe8e95f26e88259d3489853559964580ae193897a215ad9e4b14ed4')}, text='22 S. E. GATHERCOLE\\nlong-term memory and high levels of suggestibility in\\nyoung children, may be unduly pessimistic for tworeasons. First, the focus in the majority of studies iswhether there are age-related changes in children’sabilities to remember distant events. Although consistentdiﬀerences are found, in many cases they simply dem-onstrate that preschool children are relatively poorer at\\nremembering material than older children. This agediﬀerence notwithstanding, even very young childrenoften demonstrate very reliable memory performance,particularly when optimal methods of sampling memoryare used and there is no misleading information presentedsubsequently (Poole & Lindsay, 1995). Young childrenalso appear to be relatively resistant to biased questioningwhen the misleading information relates to a centralrather than peripheral feature of the original event(Pezdek & Roe, 1995). So, even preschool children arecapable of accurate memories given the right circum-stances.\\nThe second point relates to more general features of the\\nmethods used to assess children’s memories for distantspeciﬁc events. Although much of the research in this areais motivated by the need to understand the reliability oftheir testimony in court cases, the memory events thatthey feature diﬀer in many critical features from the real-life events they are designed to simulate. Eyewitnessmemory research depends largely upon laboratory-styleexperiments in which the child either hears a story orwatches a staged event of neutral emotional valence,typically as a passive bystander. In contrast, the eventswitnessed in real life by the traumatised child called toprovide witness are likely to be high in personal relevanceand emotional content, and may well have been repeatedon many occasions. So whereas eyewitness memoryexperiments tap episodic memory, in real life the child’stestimony is likely to be supported by the more powerfulautobiographical memory (Conway, 1990). Until thecontributing memory systems in the two circumstancesare aligned, it seems likely that we will inevitablyunderestimate the quality and organisation of youngchildren’s memories for important events.\\nKnowledge about Memory\\nThe primary emphasis of this article is on changes that\\ntake place in childhood in the capacity and functioning ofthree basic memory systems: short-term memory, auto-biographical memory, and episodic memory. Many otherimportant developments in memory also occur across thechildhood period, but are unfortunately beyond the scopeof the present review. One particular aspect of memorydevelopment that warrants at least a brief mention here is‘‘metamemory’’, which is the knowledge and awarenessthat an individual has about his or her own memory.Examples of activities involving metamemory includejudgements about whether one thing is likely to be easierto remember than something else, knowledge aboutwhether or not you are likely to be able to remembersomething some time in the future, and knowledge aboutwhether or not you already know a particular fact. Thetypes of metamemory possessed by children of diﬀerentages have important practical as well as theoreticalimplications, as the eﬀective training of strategies forenhancing memory performance requires the child to\\nhave some degree of awareness of how memory worksand how to inﬂuence this process (Pressley, Borkowski, &O’Sullivan, 1985).\\nStrong positive links between children’s metamemory\\njudgements and their actual memory performance hasnow been established in many tasks, demonstrating thatchildren are able to make reliable explicit judgementsabout the functioning and capacities of their basicmemory systems (Schneider, 1985). The degree ofsophistication of metamemory does, however, undergoconsiderable developmental change: the rudimentarymemory awareness demonstrated in preschool children(Schneider & Sodian, 1988) is superceded by increasingknowledge of both general and speciﬁc strategies formemory and learning which is more or less fully de-veloped by about 12 years (Schneider & Pressley, 1989,1997). Detailed accounts of the important changes inmetamemory and memory strategy training are providedby Forrest-Pressley, MacKinnon, and Waller (1985),Kail (1990), and Schneider and Pressley (1989, 1997).\\nConcluding Remarks\\nThe development of memory during childhood repre-\\nsents a crucial area of research both for cognitive anddevelopmental psychology.

As indicated in the presentselective review of memory development, the emergencein recent years both of techniques for investigating a widerange of aspects of children’s memory function and ofnew theories of memory has mapped out importantterritory for investigation in coming years. It is importantto note, however, that it is not only the theoreticians whobeneﬁt from increased understanding of children’s mem-ory resulting from this substantial research eﬀort. Mem-ory functioning during childhood has many practicalimplications, too. Professional groups who work along-side children, such as teachers, educational psychologists,lawyers, and counsellors, also need to know aboutmemory development. Unless members of these pro-fessions can readily gain access to current understandingof children’s memory and of methods for its assessment,they will be limited in the extent to which they can, forexample, make reasonable evaluations of the likelyaccuracy of eyewitness evidence from a child of aparticular age, or judge the likely educational conse-quences for a child of a speciﬁc deﬁcit in memory.Memory researchers therefore have an important re-sponsibility not only to disseminate their ﬁndings to theimmediate research community, but also to the manyother interested parties who need to know aboutchildren’s memory for practical rather than theoreticalpurposes.\\nAcknowledgements— The preparation of this article was\\nsupported by a Medical Research Council programme grant on‘‘Working Memory and Learning Disability’’ awarded to AlanD.
