Title: Computer vision for cars 
URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09093.pdf
===
Summary: Autonomous vehicle refers to a vehicle capable of
perceiving its surrounding environment and driving with little or
no human driver input. The perception system is a fundamental
component which enables the autonomous vehicle to collect data
and extract relevant information from the environment to drive
safely. Benefit from the recent advances in computer vision,
the perception task can be achieved by using sensors, such
as camera, LiDAR, radar, and ultrasonic sensor. This paper
reviews publications on computer vision and autonomous driving
that are published during the last ten years. In particular,
we first investigate the development of autonomous driving
systems and summarize these systems that are developed by
the major automotive manufacturers from different countries.
Second, we investigate the sensors and benchmark data sets
that are commonly utilized for autonomous driving. Then, a
comprehensive overview of computer vision applications for autonomous driving such as depth estimation, object detection, lane
detection, and traffic sign recognition are discussed. Additionally,
we review public opinions and concerns on autonomous vehicles.
Based on the discussion, we analyze the current technological
challenges that autonomous vehicles meet with. Finally, we
present our insights and point out some promising directions for
future research. This paper will help the reader to understand
autonomous vehicles from the perspectives of academia and industry.
